This review will serve as a review for both the out and back service from Seattle to Haneda - both flights were on the same aircraft type, and were similar enough as to not need a review for each. 

ANA's 787-9s are configured in a 1-2-1 configuration which is great, as each seat has direct aisle access, but not every window seat is the same. Much like other 1-2-1 configurations, window seats (and often the center column) are staggered, meaning some seats are more private than others. On ANA's 787-9s, odd seats are better, at least for windows. They leave the storage console between you and the aisle, making it feel far more tucked away. From SEA-HND, I had seat 9A, and from HND-SEA I had seat 6C, which allowed me to compare both. Additionally, 9A is a bulkhead seat, and thus has even more privacy.

Here is a comparison between 9A:

And 6C:

For both flights, upon arriving to my seat, I found an amenity kit waiting for me. The pouches vary slightly, but the contents do not. I noted a lack of a toothbrush in the kit - I usually like to see those. I couldn't find one in the bathroom either. I do like the reusable bag, though.

While passengers boarded, drinks were offered and hot towels were handed out, along with menus

On the flight over to Japan, given we left in the evening, I had dinner. Everything was brought out individually which is a nice touch, compared to flights where it is all brought out on a tray. First was my drink and amuse bouche

Next were the appetizers, which I wasn't a fan of. Can't go wrong with bread and olive oil, though

For this flight, and the return flight, I selected the western menu. On the way over, I had the beef, which was standard

Followed by dessert

After dinner, I was offered turndown service, which I gladly accepted, and went to sleep. Before landing, I was offered another meal, but I skipped it as I wasn't super hungry.

On the return flight from HND-SEA, I enjoyed the business class lounge in HND which had a great variety of food options. As such, I wasn't hungry when I got on the plane, and skipped the initial meal service to go straight to sleep as I was pretty tired. I slept great, and for most of the flight, so I don't have much to report on except the lunch I was offered shortly before landing. It was chicken carbonara, and actually pretty good

For both flights, service was very attentive - just the right amount so it wasn't overbearing, but also enough to make me feel very well looked after. Catering wasn't very notable out of Seattle, and a little bit better out of Haneda. Granted, I selected the western menus for both, which I would exepect isn't ANA's speciality. The hard product was adequate - the seat was perfectly comfortable, and the entertainment was good. This isn't ANA's flagship product, so I am very interested to try that and compare - I can see how a combination of the great service I had with a better hard product is rated so well globally.
