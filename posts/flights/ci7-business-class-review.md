Given China Airlines is a part of SkyTeam, I spent a short amount of time before boarding in the KAL lounge at LAX. Compared to some of the other business class lounges, I found nothing special about it. Thus, I was excited to get on board. Boarding was easy, and I quickly found my way to seat 23A.![Seat 23A, the last row of business class](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_13-57-07_938.jpeg?w=1024)

CI's 77W's use Collin's Aerospace "Super Diamond" seats, which are very comfortable, as this is a wholly nighttime flight. I also was very impressed with the overall look of the cabin, it felt very well made and cozy with the wood finishing.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_13-54-10_371.jpeg?w=1024)
Controls for the seat are somewhat limited compared to other products, but easy to use with the touchscreen![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_14-01-44_594.jpeg?w=1024)
As the rest of the passengers were boarding, I was served a hot towel, as well as a welcome drink![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_13-58-16_301.jpeg?w=1024)
Once everyone had boarded, we took off and shortly after, meal service began. First up was a drink, and a snack of nuts and fruits, although served in a bag.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_15-45-14_288.jpeg?w=1024)
After that, appetizers, bread, and a salad came out. I personally really enjoyed the garlic bread a lot.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_15-50-42_188.jpeg?w=1024)
Once I had finished the appetizers, I was brought a chicken ginseng soup. I really liked this, and am always happy to see soup on planes.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_16-03-18_891-1.jpeg?w=1024)
After this, the main course was served. For this flight, I opted for the beef, which was good, but nothing to write home about.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_16-11-16_683.jpeg?w=768)
There were two other options for the main course![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_14-14-58_223.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_14-15-16_981.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_14-15-30_510.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_14-15-24_097.jpeg?w=768)
After dinner was the cheese and dessert course. Nothing too special about the cheese, but I really enjoyed the dessert, for which I chose the mango mousse.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_16-22-33_398.jpeg?w=1024)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_16-22-34_929.jpeg?w=1024)
After the dinner course was served, I didn't see much of the flight attendants in the cabin, although to be fair there was slight turbulence for much of the flight. Because of this, I simply made the bed myself. Before I did, I had a look at the amenity kit, which curiously enough China Airlines partnered with the North Face for. It had all the standard components such as a toothbrush, comb, eye mask and ear plugs, as well as lotions.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_16-53-05_605.jpeg?w=768)
One place the China Airlines really shines is in the bedding. The heavy blanket is one of the best, and is on par with the duvet in Lufthansa first class. This is super important for these trans-Pacific routes, as sleep is super important.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_18-49-29_717.jpeg?w=768)
Throughout the flight, the bathroom was kept clean and well stocked. Like some other business class products, the bathroom had a window, which I always love to see![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-25_18-40-54_871.jpeg?w=768)
After one of the best sleeps I've had on a plane, I woke up to breakfast service. As with dinner, breakfast was good, but nothing groundbreaking.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-26_02-23-47_102.jpeg?w=1024)
Shortly after, we landed in TPE early in the morning, about half an hour ahead of schedule.
