Unfortunately for this trip, I was unable to access the Qantas lounge at LAX, so before the flight I killed some time in the Centurion Lounge. Right around boarding time, I left the lounge and went to the gate. Although there was a long line for economy passengers, the business lane was empty, and I walked right on. I was welcomed by the flight attendants and shown to my seat, 3A.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2686-1.jpg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2688.jpg)
Seat 3A is a rear facing seat window seat with direct aisle access, which gives nice privacy from the aisle and great views from the window of the engine and wing. At the seat was an amenity kit, containing earplugs, an eye mask, socks, as well as some lotions and a sample size of a Diptyque fragrance. Shortly after getting to my seat, I was offered a welcome drink and pajamas. I chose the lemon-mint drink, which was excellent.![The Lemon Mint welcome drink](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2687.jpg?w=1024)

After a little wait, we pushed back and took off. I really enjoyed watching the cameras on the IFE during takeoff, and wish more planes had this option. Shortly after takeoff, dinner service started. The table was set, and after a bowl of nuts, I was given the amuse bouche. I forgot to take a picture of the menu, but it seemed to be lobster with avocado, lime, and covered in gold leaf. I also really enjoyed the selection of bread and olive oil.![Set Table](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2711.jpg?w=1024)

Shortly after, the appetizer was served. I selected the Arabic Mezze, which was served with warm pita bread, and it was delicious.![Arabic Mezze](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2715.jpg?w=1024)

Later, my entrée of pan fried chicken and vegetable arrived. As with everything else, it was very tasty.![Chicken and Vegetables Main Course](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2716.jpg?w=768)

Finally, for my dessert, I selected the ice cream, which was well presented and tasted good, although the ice cream was very frozen when it got to me.![Ice Cream Sundae Dessert](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2717.jpg?w=768)

At this point, lights were dimmed and it was time for turn down service. While I changed into my pajamas, the crew added a mattress pad to my seat, and I was ready for bed. The bathroom was well stocked and clean, with full toothbrushes available for passengers. It even had a window, which I really liked. I got decent sleep, but woke up when we were crossing over the arctic to a northern lights display outside the window.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2719.jpg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2724.jpg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2726.jpg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2729.jpg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2725.jpg)
Right before landing, breakfast was served. I started out with some warm pastries, which was followed by a truffle omelet.![Omelet](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2736.jpg?w=1024)

Shortly after that, we landed in Doha, about a little ahead of schedule.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_2743.jpg)
