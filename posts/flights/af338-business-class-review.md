Transatlantic products are tricky - many of them are outdated or not 1-2-1. I knew Air France was better in this regard, and as I was having trouble finding efficient flights out of ARN back to the west coast, when I was able to find a ARN-CDG-SEA itinerary for a good price, I jumped on it. The flight from ARN-CDG was standard regional business in Europe - middle seat blocked, and a meal. But no regional business is interesting enough to get its own post, so we're focused on CDG-SEA.

The night before in ARN, there was a pretty big rain/thunderstorm. This had 2 effects. For me, it meant I had to close the window, which made my room extremely hot in the continent of no AC or fans, and very hard to sleep. Which meant I was pretty tired. It also flooded the at-gate fueling mechanism, which meant the plane (and not just ours) had to be fueled manually, so things were running slow. This turned an already tight connection in CDG into a very close one, but luckily my outbound flight to SEA had a slight delay, so I arrived at my gate right as they were boarding. But it meant I didn't get to check out the business class lounge in CDG.

With security checks for US-bound flights, boarding was chaos. My seat for today was 2L

On Air France's A350-900s, the even rows are better, are the seat is right up against the window and the console between you and the aisle, making it more private

Controls for the seat have to be the most simple I've encountered. No way to mess anything up with these

An amenity kit was offered to me by an FA after getting to my seat, which was well stocked. I also really like the pouch, and is one of the few I keep to use

We were also offered drinks while other passengers boarded, and eventually left CDG with ~15mins of delay. The menu for this flight was mostly lunch, as it was a purely daytime flight. Unrelated side note - but I always love when planes have cameras that I can view on the IFE

To start meal service after takeoff, we were given baked cheese crepes. I'm not the only one with this opinion, but these were insanely good

The appetizer and salad were next. The smoked salmon was okay, but neither really stood out to me. The real star of the show showed up next - the duck lasagna. Although more akin to a big ravioli, this was easily one of the top 3 meals I've had on a plane - it was insanely tasty and rich, without being too much. And relatively simple. I knew Air France was supposed to have good catering, but they really knocked it out of the park with this one. It's good I remembered to take a picture, even if it was after starting to devour it, because it didn't last long

After lunch, I leaned the seat back and took a really good nap - unusual for me on daytime flights like this, but given how poorly I slept the night prior, it turns out I was quite tired. Before landing, we were offered more meals. Again, these started with the cheese crepes, which I would be crazy to turn down. The actual meal was chicken and potatoes - not by any account bad, but just not in the league of the duck lasngna

I usually try to avoid flights between Europe and the West Coast, as being daytime flights they're really hard to sleep on. However, given my situation, that was no problem. I found the product, both catering and the hard product, to be great on this flight. Flight attendants were nice and efficient, and the food left me wanting more, which is rare on planes. I would absolutely fly Air France again
