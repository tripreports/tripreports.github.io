After a pretty disappointing trip over the Atlantic for my trip around the Gulf in Virgin Atlantic, I was pretty excited when I was able to find myself a QSuite home - something I've flown before and know will do the trick. However, I'm not a huge fan of flying west, as they're typically daytime flights which give me more jetlag, and I'd never done so on Qatar. To combat this, the night before the flight, I slept only for an hour or two very early, to make sure I would be tired on the plane. When I arrived to Hamad, I made my way to the business class check in. Although I was originally booked in an aisle seat, the check in staff were able to release the block that was on 1A and assign it to me, which was a huge win as it's both a window and rear facing, which are way more private in QSuites. After a wonderful (and fatigued) stay in the Al Mourjan Garden lounge, I made my way to my gate. I'm not a huge fan of Doha's additional at gate security, as it always creates a mess, especially for big flights. Regardless, I eventually boarded and made my way to 1A

As usual on Qatar's A350-1000s, I was happy to see air vents, as well as the nice lighting they apply to the cabin.

Waiting for me at my seat was an amenity pouch (instead of the box that I've gotten so often with Qatar). Well stocked as usual. Additionally, I was offered a beverage while the other passengers boarded. If you pick anything other than the lemon mint cocktail, you're doing it wrong

Our menu for today was flipped from the usual one I'm used to, as breakfast was recommended after departure and lunch before arrival. I was super exicted to try another dish from Chef Noor - Qatar's in house catering at Doha, after how delicious my machboos were on my last ex-DOH flight.

Once all the passengers had boarded we took off, a few minutes late as seems to be the norm for Doha, and breakfast was served. I chose the omelette with chicken sausage. Good, but not necesarily special.

At this point, I was pretty tired, so I had my seat put down and went to sleep. I slept for a good few hours, but given how long this flight was, there was still a good chunk of time left in the flight after waking up. I managed to binge watch the entire first season of The Day of The Jackal. Before landing, lunch was served, which was way more delicious than breakfast. It's hard to compare but I don't think it was as good as the machboos, but still quite tasty

To wrap it up, I had some berries as dessert

Shortly after, we landed in LAX ahead of schedule, despite the departure delay. Being my first westward QSuite, I was a little turned around, and especially given I didn't sleep for much of the flight like I usually do, I was reminded how long these flights are. Made me glad to be all the way up in 1A for that amount of time. 

Note - this will be my last QSuites review, not because I am going to stop flying them (quite the opposite) but because I think I have about covered everything across my reviews of them over the past few years and at this point I don't have much more to add with additional reviews
