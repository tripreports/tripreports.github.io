On my way back from a wonderful trip in Oman, although I flew back through Doha I couldn't fly in Qsuites back home. However, I was able to book business class in Royal Air Maroc's business class, with a layover in Casablanca. RAM is a small airline, so I was interested to see the offering. Following a very tight connection in Doha, we were taken to the plane via a bus, and I found my way to seat 2K.![Seat 2K - note the loading screen on the IFE](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_14-35-29_531.jpeg?w=1024)

The first flight, from Doha to Casablanca, was on RAM's 787-9, which are its newer planes. In business class, the cabin is equipped with super diamond seats, which I find very comfortable and enjoy as it offers each seat direct aisle access.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_14-35-49_401.jpeg)
Waiting for me at my seat was an amenity kit. RAM's business amenity kits are well stocked, and were identical for both my flights.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_08-34-08_145.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_08-34-37_902.jpeg)
Shortly after getting to my seat, I was offered a choice of welcome drink, and I chose mint lemonade. This one was different than the one I've come to know and love on Qatar, and was a little lighter and more watery - not as good.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_14-41-04_156-1.jpeg)
We were also given a menu for the flight![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_14-44-07_308.jpeg)
As you can see in the background of all these photos, the IFE was in a constant state of loading screen. This never resolved itself, unfortunately. Once all the passengers were onboard, we took off from Hamad Airport just a few minutes late. After watching take off from my window seat, I moved to seat 2E (at the suggestion of one of the flight attendants), which had functioning IFE. Dinner was quickly served - I selected beef tenderloin, and the caramel cake for dessert (I forgot to take a picture, but it was good). Given I was pretty tired, I skipped everything else in favor of sleep.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_16-06-59_937.jpeg)
The food was nothing special, but given the hectic transfer I had in Doha, I was pretty hungry, so it was well appreciated. After dinner, I went back to 2K, which I set to lie flat, and went to sleep until I was woken up for breakfast. As with dinner, breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, but made for a decent meal.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-23_22-15-40_312.jpeg)
We arrived in Casablanca just around sunrise, a few minutes late. Given my next flight didn't leave until 15:00, I had a very long layover, and thus I opted to go into Casablanca to see a few sights, before coming back to the airport (details in a separate page).![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_02-15-34_732.jpeg)
Getting back into the airport, I was able to use the priority lane for security, and got to spend a little time at the RAM business class lounge, which doesn't compete with other business class lounges I've visited, and had mediocre food. I made my way to the gate shortly before boarding, and unfortunately had to get rid of a bottle of water at secondary screening. When I was time to board, I made my way onto the 787-8. On board, I was surprised to see a different business class configuration, this time an older 2-2-2 config. I made my way to my seat (2A), and hoped I didn't have a seat mate, so I could have pseudo-direct aisle access.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_07-31-22_843.jpeg)
I was offered a welcome drink, for which I chose the mint lemonade again. Boarding took a while, but luckily the seat next to me ended up empty. Otherwise, I would have been sharing the footwell with my seatmate - when put into lie flat mode, my seat elevates more than 2C, giving me the upper foot rest, and 2C the lower![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_07-35-11_122.jpeg)
A menu was also distributed prior to take off![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_08-09-50_237.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_08-10-01_960.jpeg)
One place where I see a distinction between RAM and other carriers is in the selection of teas - it's an important part of Moroccan culture and nice to see it reflected in the country's carrier. Shortly after takeoff, the appetizers were served, along with some almonds and olives, served in a bag.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_08-48-02_660.jpeg)
For my main course, I selected the roasted salmon, which fit the norm for all of the other food on RAM - decent, but nothing special. Dessert might have been the tastiest, with the crunchy dark chocolate cake.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_09-38-18_978.jpeg)
After a quick dinner service, I put the seat to lie flat, and tried to dim my windows, only to find they were locked by the crew. It took a good 30 minutes after most passengers had finished their meal for the windows to all be dimmed. Once they were, I went to sleep for what was surprisingly the most undisturbed sleep on a plane I've had in a while. I woke up as we were quite literally descending into IAD - well past breakfast service, and also past when I've been sometimes told to put my seat up. I do wonder how long it would have taken for me to get woken by the crew. I had a decent layover in IAD which allowed me to visit the Turkish lounge and get some delicious food, but otherwise I might have been a little miffed at missing breakfast.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-03-24_16-23-26_446.jpeg)
**Overall Impressions:**

I found both flights to be very similar in a lot of regards, except for the product. Service wasn't necessarily personable or attentive on either flights, but given for how much of the flight I was sleeping, I didn't really mind. I think the best term to describe the service would be efficient. None of the food stuck out to me a delicious, but was all passable. I also found the bedding to be a little lacking, and given I was mostly after sleeping on these flights, this might be my biggest gripe about the offering. On the contrary, I did enjoy the little touches of Morocco that made it into the product, such as the offerings of tea, as well as the colorful cabin. The amenity kits were also well stocked. Overall, I found the offering to be acceptable, but nothing really outstanding, and although I wouldn't mind flying again with them, I don't think I would go out of my way to do so.
