# SQ231 Suites Review

What better product to pick for my first flight on an A380 than Singapore Suites. Suites is know as one of, if not the best products in commerical aviation. The only real competition is Etihad's The Residence, but the configuration of a detached recliner and bed isn't something you see in the air much, and is much more akin to a private plane than commercial upper cabins. Thus, I was pretty excited to get to fly it to Sydney

After a short flight in from KUL, I had a few hours to check out the lounge in SIN. Suites (and only suites, not first class passengers in products that aren't the A380's suites) are allowed into the "private room", which is a seperate part of Singapore's first class lounge. Upon arrival, you'll be escorted there, and can pick any of the semi private booths

The space is very open, quiet, and not crowded. I was offered a drink, and given a menu with a wide range of made to order options

I ordered a negroni and a small snack, as I was still recovering from a little bug I caught in Malaysia. Both were really tasty

I also went to check out the regular first class lounge. It was also quite nice, although it had a buffet with some really good dim sum. Definitely worth a trip to see what the buffet there has to offer. The private room also had showers and bathrooms with amenities such as dental kits. Definitely a good stop. Soon after midnight, I made my way to my gate, and onto the plane. It was super cool getting to go up the ramp to the upper deck of the A380. At the door, I was greeted, and escorted to my seat 3A

I knew that the suite would be spacious, but I have to admit I was still taken aback. On a plane which is wide enough to host a 1-2-1 business class configuration, suites are two to a row, meaning that the bed runs perpendicular to the plane itself. The recliner is decently sized, and there's just a lot of space to move around. There is no overhead storage in FC on the A380, which also likely contributes to the spacious nature. There is a coat/carry on closet right at the entrance to store things in. A menu was on the table by the entrance

Controls for the seat are hidden from view under the left armrest

In the cabinet by the window, headphones and the best stocked amenity kit I've received were waiting for me. The kit included all the usual suspects, plus a full sized cologne. The headphones were probably the best quality headphones I've had on a plane, and I ended up using them instead of my AirPods + AirFly combo which I usually do.

I was also offered some pyjamas

During boarding, I was offered a drink, and I selected some Krug. I was also offered (and accepted) a couple refills before takeoff. As well as after takeoff. In suites, the density of cabin crew to passengers is pretty high (as it's maximum 6 passengers). Although I found I had one primary cabin crew who was very pleasant, and I was very well attended to.

After a relatively ontime departure from SIN, mealservice was started. Of course, everything is on your own schedule in Suites, but it seems the recommended is a light snack with caviar after takeoff and a bigger meal before landing. So dinner for me was a dinner of champions: caviar, krug, and fruit

After dinner, I went to the bathroom to change into my pyjamas while the bed was setup. The bathroom was the biggest bathroom I've seen on a plane - the amount of unused space blew my mind. There was a seperate stool/area to change, in addition to the toilet, which saved me from the usual confined changing in regular business class bathrooms. Once I got back to my seat, my bed was ready for me

The bed was long enough for me, and it was the most comfortable bed I've enjoyed in the sky. Where usual lieflats narrow around the feet and can feel constrained around the shoulders, the fact that the bed was completely seperate from the chair made it just like a regular bed. Which, on a plane, is so far from the norm, and so appreciated. I almost didn't want to go to sleep so as to enjoy it. It's also possible to rotate the TV to watch TV in bed

In order to savor my time in the incredible bed, I skipped meal service before landing to rest. Ultimately, the flight from SIN-SYD isn't really long enough to get a good amount of sleep, so I wanted to rest for as long as possible. Shortly before landing, I changed back into my clothes and returned to the chair as the bed had to be folded up. Before landing in Sydney, we were put in a holding pattern - which I couldn't have been happier about.

Singapore Suites was a bucketlist item for me, and it didn't dissapoint. Everything from the lounge to deboarding was extremely well done, with nice touches all along the way. It's unfortunate that these flights are so scarce - Singapore's A380 fleet isn't massive and they only fly them to a limited number of destinations. But I would prioritize flying Suites again over any other product, as this is hands down the best flight I've taken.
