# JX32 Business Class Review

**Date:** 10/20/2025
**Airline:** Starlux
**Flight Number:** JX32
**Aircraft:** A350-900
**From/To:** TPE-SEA
**Distance Flown:** 6,063 mi

Starlux is a new airline I've been really interested in trying. The last of the 3 large, well known Taiwanese airlines for me to try, but definitely not the least. Online checkin wasn't working, and after a delay on my flight from Singapore with a different carrier, I arrived to TPE about 15 minutes before boarding with no boarding pass. I went to the transit center hoping they could check me in there, but there was no Starlux desk. Luckily, one of the agents there was super helpful and managed to call Starlux, confirm I was on the flight, and get me through transit security. I was worried I would have to immigrate, check in, and emmigrate but he luckily saved me from doing so. I got to the gate right as they were starting to board, and got checked in there. Not as much time as I would have liked, but there's nothing like a connection with maximum efficiency.

My seat for today was 4K.

The cabin was relatively empty, and I did note the first row looked like premium business class or first class, definitely differentiated from business class. Will have to try it one day

The seat itself is pretty standard, although I do have to admit everything felt very new on this plane.

One thing that shocked me was the windows had the same dimming functionality as on Dreamliners. Never before have I seen that on an A350, or any other plane for that matter

Controls for it, unlike the dreamliner, are at the screen next to the seat

As well as controls for the seat

Pretty standard to many other seats, there was also a nice storage cabinet with headphones and a bottle of water next to the seat, and in it a charging port and remote

Before takeoff, I was offered a drink and a warm towel, and given a menu. Like many Asian carriers, Starlux offers both a western and asian menu. For this flight, I selected the asian menu, as they partner with a Taiwanese chef and the entree looked really good. We departed about 30 minutes late, and dinner service started pretty soon after. First out was the salad

After that was what I was really looking forward to - the braised beef. It didn't disappoint - was very tender and well seasoned. Didn't last long

To wrap everything up, I enjoyed some fruit and ice cream. I then headed to the bathroom to brush my teeth. My (possibly only) complaint for this flight was that there was no amenity kit. It could have been hidden somewhere in the seat, or just not available, but I was never offered one. Thus, I had to use my own amenities, which were luckily close at hand in my carry on. Pyjamas, however, were offered, which I changed into before bed. My bed was made and I relaxed a little before getting a great amount of sleep, waking up a few hours out of seattle

Before landing in Seattle, I had some breakfast. It was standard, and didn't stick out to me as much as dinner.

And to wrap it all up, I enjoyed a little bubble tea and fruit - something I've never had on a flight before. Doing Taiwan justice, the tea was great.

Overall, Starlux met my expectations well, easily earning a spot in my list of favorite business classes, right behind Qatar and others of that magnitude. The food was great, the seat was great - my only real complaint is the lack of amenity kit. But I'll definitly be back on board, hopefully soon
