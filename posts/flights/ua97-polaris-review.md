Having previously flown Polaris from SFO-AKL on a 777-200ER I had a good sense of what the product would be, and I was excited to try it on a newer plane. If it wasn't clear already, I'm a big fan of 787s, as their bleedless cabin air intake makes for a very comfortable and humid cabin. Having been flying for multiple days at this point, I was ready for a good rest. Polaris is know as a very comfortable hard product, with somewhat lacking catering options. However, I was interested to see if a flight leaving from an out station would have better catering.

It was a rainy day in Brisbane, being still spring, which made the flight quite empty. Boarding was quick, and I arrived to my seat 3A. Controls for the seat are easy to use and not worn out. Not as feature rich as QSuites, but it does the job.

Takeoff was a little bumpy and shortly after, we were given hot towels, a beverage (I chose orange juice as I wasn't planning on being awake for a while) and nuts

We were also offered pyjamas - which were not available on my flight leaving SFO. Impressive that they managed to stock enough this time to make it out and back. On offer today was the special Wrexham FC edition, which were quite confortable. An amenity kit was also waiting for me at my seat, with all the usual items in it. This pouch was a crossbody bag

Not too long later, meal service started. For my entree, I selected the beef brisket, but forgot to take a photo of it. Here's my salad instead

After dinner, I was offered some ice cream, which I gladly accepted. Toppings were added to order, which I found to be pretty fun. The dessert never fails me - and it might have been the most memorable part of the meal service on the flight

Interestingly, although very friendly, I found that service was a little unattentive at times. Once I had finished my ice cream, I left the bowl on my tray table. Usually, after a few minutes, an FA will come down the aisle and clear the tray, but after 10 or 15 minutes nobody had come down my aisle. It could have been a function of me being ahead of everyone else as I was quick to eat (very eager to get to sleep) or just because it was an empty flight, but after a while I just cleared the table myself, putting all the items on the storage console, went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, put the bed flat myself and went to sleep. I slept all the way through until a few hours before landing, when I was awoken for breakfast.

Breakfast wasn't bad - the pancakes were really soft. Overall, the food was passable - nothing memorable to be generous. However, what Polaris lacked in cuisine, it made up for in terms of comfort. The lay flat was very comfortable, and I appreciate all the bedding options - having a dedicated blanket and duvet is really a step up. The ride on the 787 was smooth and easy as usual, which made this a very restful flight, and eliminated any jetlag on the tail end of my trip
