Gulf Air is the lesser known airline that operates out of the Gulf, compared to Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad. However, they did appear to have a good business class product, and when I found a suitable flight on my trip home, I jumped at the opportunity. My first stop for this trip was the Falcon Gold lounge in Bahrain. I didn't get a chance to take any pictures of the lounge, apart from the shower amenities (which I thought were above average) and the shower itself (which I thought could use a renovation).![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_08-54-16_951.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_08-55-13_877.jpeg)
For the shower, I was given slippers, a razor and shaving cream, a toothbrush and toothpaste, a bag with soap, a shower cap, and of course a towel. As I said, I wasn't very impressed with the shower itself, but it was well appreciated regardless after being out in the day in August in the gulf.

Otherwise, I found the lounge to be okay. There was a decent selection of food, but the lounge is not closed off from the main terminal, so when that gets loud, you hear it in the lounge. Regardless, as boarding time approached, I made my way to the gate. This was a nighttime flight, leaving around 22:00, so I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the plane after dinner.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-11-55_946.jpeg)
I was one of the first to board the plane, and was happy to see the business cabin was laid out in with Apex suites. I had never flown in the before, so I was excited to try it. My seat was 2A for this flight.![Seat 2A on the right](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-12-01_683.jpeg?w=1024)

As is clear from the picture, window seats in this configuration are quite private. Here is a picture from in the seat - it's very tucked away from the cabin.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-21-22_938.jpeg)
The seat itself was comfortable. Bedding and an amenity kit were waiting for me at the seat. I enjoyed the very unique horse design on the kit, and its contents were standard - toothbrush, eyemask and earplugs, socks, as well as some lotions, and being a gulf carrier, they included a small sample size of eau de toilette. One area I found a little lacking was the bedding, Gulf Air could really step up the business class bedding and include a heavier blanket.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-12-43_112.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-15-56_495.jpeg)
Shortly after boarding I was offered a welcome beverage. Being in the gulf, the only right choice is the mint lemonade. Interestingly, I found that Gulf Air didn't advertise any alcohol. It could be a dry airline, or it could be by request only. Either way, I was more than happy to get a mint lemonade![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-17-00_279.jpeg)
The menu was pretty simple for this flight![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-25-47_285.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-26-03_742.jpeg)
After all the passengers had boarded, we left the gate, and took off on our way to Shanghai. Soon after that, the meal service started. First, we were offered dates and Arabic Coffee. Afterwards, warm nuts and a drink were served![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_12-42-20_967.jpeg)
As an appetizer, I selected the Arabic Mezze, which was quite different than what I expected based on Qatar's version - this wasn't served with pita bread. Nonetheless, it was quite good.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_13-06-38_828.jpeg)
For my main course, I selected the Lamb Salona, and it did not disappoint. The flavors were great, and the lamb was really well cooked - it goes on my list of top food I've had on airplanes.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_13-16-21_536.jpeg)
After dinner, I selected the cheesecake to end the meal service![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_13-46-09_891.jpeg)
After that, it was time for me to get some sleep, as I was exhausted and had a long daytime layover ahead of me in Shanghai. I put the seat down, set do not disturb on the seat controls, and went to sleep.![Do not disturb is on the left](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-10_11-15-30_855.jpeg?w=1024)

I was so tired, and the 787s are so easy to sleep on, that I slept all the way through breakfast service and woke up as we were on approach to PVG. Although a little sad to miss breakfast, I was super happy that I was able to sleep all the way through. Shortly after waking up, we touched down in Shanghai right around on time.

Although Gulf Air doesn't have the reach that the other gulf carriers do, which is likely why it isn't as well known, I really enjoyed my time on it. Dinner was great, and service was as well. There were a few points which could use polishing, but overall the product is great, and I would be happy to fly with them again.
