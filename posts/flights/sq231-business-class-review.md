A short review for a short flight. This might be the least amount of time I've spent in a premium cabin. But having never been on Singapore in business, I wanted to see if it's something I would fly long haul

This flight served as a connection flight from KUL-SIN for my SIN-SYD Suites flight. After visiting some lounges at KUL, I boarded and made my way to seat 16K - my home for less than an hour

Only a pillow was waiting for me at my seat - no other amenities needed. More controls than normal for the seat

Once everyone had boarded, we tookoff. Really soon after takeoff cabin crew started meal service. The two options we both snacks - I went with the minced chicken, which was really good

I didn't have much time to eat, and shortly after cabin crew started to prepare for landing. Not too long after, we arrived in SIN - 23 mintes ahead of schedule for an already short flight
