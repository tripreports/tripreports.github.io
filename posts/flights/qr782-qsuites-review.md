Having previously flown this route on an A350, I was interested to see how different the product was on the 77L. Having got into MIA a few hours earlier, I spent my time at the Flagship First lounge, which I found to have lacking food options (although I did enjoy the self-serve full bar). Just before business class started boarding, I left the lounge and made my way to the gate. Boarding was easy, and I found my way to my seat, 10K.![Seat 10K](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_05-59-58_825.jpeg?w=1024)
*Seat 10K*

Waiting at my seat was everything I've come to expect in Qsuites - bedding, the headset, a bottle of water, and an amenity kit.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-07-42_147.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-08-47_151.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-09-15_358.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-13-17_340.jpeg?w=768)
A menu and pajamas were also distributed before takeoff![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-01-51_547.jpeg?w=1024)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-03-22_419.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-03-31_977.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-04-30_576.jpeg?w=768)
As usual, a refreshing towel and a welcome beverage was served. I chose my usual - the mint lemonade.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_06-15-21_656.jpeg?w=1024)
As this flight left late at night, I was pretty tired, and I dozed off after takeoff. Once I woke up, meal service had already started, and there was a glass of champagne and a bowl of nuts waiting for me![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_07-55-37_299.jpeg?w=768)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_07-55-42_479.jpeg?w=768)
Soon after, the table was set, and I was given an amuse bouche, along with some warm bread, olive oil, and butter![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_00-08-44_417-1.jpeg?w=1024)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_00-10-16_028.jpeg?w=1024)
For an appetizer, as usual, I chose the Arabic mezze, which was delicious (unsurprisingly)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_08-11-15_365.jpeg?w=1024)
For my main course, I elected for the Chicken Mashkhool. It was similar to, but not as good as, the Chicken Machboos I had on a previous Qatar flight![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_00-30-17_704.jpeg?w=1024)
Finally, for dessert, I chose the ice cream, which was tasty as usual![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_08-53-24_529.jpeg?w=1024)
After dinner, I watched some movies, and then asked for turndown service to get some sleep![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-28_09-49-45_579-1.jpeg?w=1024)
I got a lot of sleep, and woke up in time for breakfast service. However, given I was still quite full, I elected to skip it. Shortly before landing, we were given a small box of chocolates and a refreshing towel.
