Normally, I find that economy is just fine for short flights. Coming in at just over 2 hours of flight time, I would have been fine not being in business for this flight, but given it was attached to the previous flight into PVG on Gulf Air on the same ticket, it was easier to make this flight in business as well. The aircraft for the flight was Eva's A330-300, which has a business class cabin configured in a 2-2-2 layout. This could have been a problem for a long flight, or if I had a seatmate. Luckily, neither was true.![Seat 9K is the window](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_04-39-05_266.jpeg?w=1024)

Waiting for me at my seat was a pillow, headphones, as well as a pair of slippers, and the menu for today. Additionally, one of the flight attendants came around and offered a blanket, which was very nice.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_04-41-09_402.jpeg?w=768)
Shortly after getting seated, I was offered a cold towel, and a welcome beverage, which I chose a passion fruit juice for. It was very good![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_04-42-09_712.jpeg?w=1024)
After takeoff, dinner was served, in a consolidated manner due to the short nature of the flight. I selected the chicken, and it was good, but nothing special. The garlic bread was amazing though, crunchy and warm.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_05-39-37_577.jpeg?w=1024)
After I had finished dinner, I put my seat back, and enjoyed the remaining 30 minutes of the flight. I was impressed that with such a short flight, there was still a full meal service. Although the food was good, where the flight really shined for me was the service - all the flight attendants on the flight were incredibly nice and friendly. This flight made me very excited for my next flight with Eva, the following day.
