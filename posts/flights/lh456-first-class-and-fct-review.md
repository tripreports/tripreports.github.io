I had heard a lot about Lufthansa's First class, as well as the first class terminal, so I was very excited to try the product out. Additionally, I was super excited to be on a 747, as I don't think these planes will be around forever. As this flight was scheduled to leave in the morning, I got to the first class terminal bright and early, to make sure I could enjoy it.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_21-22-01_085.jpeg)
There are a couple different entries, depending on where you're dropped off, but everything is well marked and easy to navigate. After taking the elevator up, I was met by a staff member, who guided me through the private security channel. After the brief security process, I took a seat, and was offered some fresh pressed orange juice.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_21-30-21_731.jpeg)
Shortly after, the member of staff who guided me though security came back with my boarding pass, as well as a rubber duck, an icon of the FCT![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_21-35-07_024.jpeg)
As I hadn't eaten anything prior, I was pretty hungry, so I decided to visit the restaurant. It's a combined buffet and sit down restaurant, where you can order something from a menu, and take from the very well stocked buffet. To keep things light, I ordered an omelet, which was good.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_23-03-38_538.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_23-03-40_257.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_23-07-04_535.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_23-22-05_626.jpeg)
Once it was time to board, the same staff member came to find me (very nice that I didn't have to worry about keeping track of time myself) and guided me downstairs to passport control. The FCT has it's own dedicated passport control, and I was through in seconds. Once all the first class passengers were ready to board, we were taken to a van (sadly no Porsche for this flight) and driven to the plane. It was super cool to get some views of our 747 from the ground, before we went up to the jetbridge in an elevator.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_01-12-18_794.jpeg)
After getting on board, I was taken to my seat, 3K.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_01-15-20_500.jpeg)
Instead of overhead storage, first class has small lockers that passengers can place their bags in.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_01-40-32_403.jpeg)
After getting to my seat, I was offered champagne and macadamia nuts. As I would find, one thing that you can't do in Lufthansa's first class is go hungry - every time I finished the dish of nuts, another showed up in no time.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_01-18-58_275.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_01-20-21_796.jpeg)
Seat controls were in the left armrest, and were easy to use. I like the fact that they were under a cover - on other products, I have accidentally bumped buttons which change the seat's settings.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_02-25-34_972.jpeg)
Pajamas were also brought before takeoff, which in addition to the amenity kit and some of the thickest slippers I've seen, made for a good set of amenities on the flight.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_05-10-06_331.jpeg)
Amenity kit contents were standard, and although somewhat lacking compared to other carriers such as Qatar, was adequate, which socks, an eyemask, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste, a shoe horn, and lotions.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-31_07-18-18_587-1.jpeg)
We left Frankfurt a little late, and shortly after the lunch service began. I started with an amuse bouche and more champagne.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_02-44-03_127.jpeg)
After the amuse bouche, I was given some bread and olive oil. I enjoyed the pretzel, which was a nice touch of German from Lufthansa.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_03-13-17_925.jpeg)
After the bread was a caviar course. I had mine with toast, eggs, onion, and sour cream, and it was tasty.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_03-30-34_923.jpeg)
I had selected one of the three appetizers. However, the very personable flight attendant brought all three options, and told me to try them all. I was starting to understand people we're lying when they said its not possible to go hungry in LH F. All three were very tasty, and I even enjoyed the lobster despite not generally liking shellfish.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_03-46-20_586.jpeg)
After all this, it was finally time for my main course, which I selected the steak. It was good, and well cooked, but nothing that stood out.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_04-01-52_119.jpeg)
To wrap things up, for dessert I got a chocolate cake, which was really good, and some baileys.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_04-15-39_373.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_04-23-23_216.jpeg)
As if that weren't enough, I was given a small menu of truffles I could order, and selected a few.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_04-34-21_864.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_04-34-25_061.jpeg)
Shortly after lunch service wrapped up, I got my bed turned down while I changed into my pajamas. The bathroom was unsurprisingly well stocked and  clean throughout the flight.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_05-37-27_594.jpeg)
Just as I was falling asleep for my nap, the flight attendant woke me up to tell to to have a look out my window. Earlier in the flight, we had discussed different airlines, and I had mentioned how I was recently on Qatar Airways. Out the window was a Qatar Airways cargo jet flying on our same course, just a little bit slower and below us. It's the closest I've seen planes pass, and was super cool to see, and I really appreciate the FA for going out of their way to let me know. We tried to airdrop the picture to the QR pilots to no avail.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_05-51-31_553.jpeg)
After a nap, it was time for a little breakfast before landing, but given how full I still was from lunch, I opted for something lighter, so I just went for some fruits and desserts. Both were very tasty![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-30_10-49-20_224.jpeg)
We made up a little time in the air, and were only about 15 minutes late getting into LAX. As this was my first first class flight, I was interested to see the difference between it and business class on other airlines. Definitely, I would argue the hard product is lacking when compared to business class suites, purely due to a lack of privacy (although given how small the FC cabin really is, it's not a huge issue). However, the main difference I saw was in the service - both FAs in the cabin were incredibly friendly and had great attention to detail. Service felt less rushed than some of the business class offerings, and this service is apparent through many small details, such as the Qatar plane spotting. Overall, it was a wonderful flight, and I hope to be back.
