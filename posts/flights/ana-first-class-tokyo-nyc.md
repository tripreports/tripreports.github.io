## Overview

All Nippon Airways (ANA) is renowned for having one of the best First Class products in the sky, and this flight on their 777-300ER did not disappoint. From the moment of boarding to touchdown in New York, every aspect of the experience exemplified Japanese hospitality and attention to detail.

## Ground Experience

The experience began at the ANA First Class check-in counter at Narita Airport. Check-in was seamless, and I was escorted to the ANA Lounge, which is consistently rated as one of the world's best airport lounges.

The lounge features:
- Multiple dining areas with à la carte menu
- Premium champagne and sake selection
- Private nap rooms
- Shower suites
- Traditional Japanese garden views

## Boarding & Cabin

Boarding was conducted by rows, with First Class passengers welcomed first. The cabin features just 8 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration across two rows. Each suite is incredibly spacious with:

- Full flat bed (6'7" / 200cm)
- 24" personal TV screen
- Large personal storage areas
- Multiple charging ports and USB connections
- Privacy divider

The soft product included Globe-Trotter amenity kits, pajamas, and slippers. The bedding was some of the most comfortable I've experienced in the air.

## Dining

The dining experience was truly exceptional. ANA serves contemporary Japanese kaiseki cuisine prepared by world-class chefs.

### Welcome Drink
Dom Pérignon 2013 champagne with Japanese rice crackers

### Appetizers
- Seasonal sashimi platter
- Foie gras terrine
- Grilled seasonal vegetables

### Main Course
I selected the Japanese option:
- Grilled Wagyu beef with wasabi sauce
- Seasonal tempura
- Steamed rice with pickles
- Miso soup

### Dessert
- Matcha tiramisu
- Fresh fruit plate
- Japanese sweets selection

The presentation was impeccable, served on fine china with proper silverware. The flight attendants took their time with each course, never rushing the experience.

## Service

The service was truly world-class. The cabin crew was attentive without being intrusive, anticipating needs before being asked. Every request was met with genuine warmth and professionalism. The crew members addressed me by name throughout the flight and made the 14-hour journey feel effortless.

## In-Flight Entertainment

The entertainment system featured:
- Over 100 new release movies
- Extensive TV show selection
- Music library
- Games
- Flight information

The 24" screen was crisp and responsive, and the noise-cancelling headphones were excellent quality.

## Sleep Experience

After dinner service, the crew prepared my bed with a mattress pad, duvet, and multiple pillow options. The seat fully reclines into a completely flat bed, and I was able to get 7 solid hours of sleep. The cabin lighting was kept very dim, and the crew was virtually silent during designated rest hours.

## Pre-Arrival

About 90 minutes before landing, I was gently woken with a light breakfast service:
- Fresh fruit and yogurt
- Croissant and pastries
- Japanese breakfast option
- Fresh juice and coffee

## Final Thoughts

ANA First Class is truly one of the pinnacle experiences in aviation. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, from the sublime dining to the comfortable bedding to the warm, genuine service. While the hard product may not be the most modern (compared to newer suites on the A380s), the soft product and service more than make up for it.
