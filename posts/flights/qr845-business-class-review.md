After a good visit to the expansive Malaysian Airlines business class lounge, I made my way to boarding. Shortly before the flight, it was announced that this flight had been switched to an aircraft using Qatar's old business class configuration (2-2-2) instead of Qsuites. Given it was not a long haul, overnight flight, I wasn't too upset, and was interested to see the other product. I boarded quickly, and made my way to my seat, 5K![Seat 5K](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_17-25-47_689-1.jpeg?w=834)
*Seat 5K*

Waiting for me at the seat was the standard Qatar business class bedding (which I very much like) and an amenity kit. The amenity kit was well stocked, as usual.![Amenity kit contents (taken at my hotel in Doha)](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_03-40-46_017.jpeg?w=768)

Shortly after getting seated, the flight attendant came around and offered us a welcome drink. Having flown on Qatar before, I knew what I wanted - the mint lemonade![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_17-30-40_913.jpeg)
The shared space between the seats got a little crowded since I had someone directly adjacent to me. Additionally, the divider between the seats seemed to be stuck, but again given it was a daytime flight, it wasn't an issue. A menu was distributed prior to take off and our order was taken.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_17-53-54_907.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_17-55-13_685.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_17-54-07_261.jpeg)
After take off, the table was set, and I started off with some nuts and a rum and coke, followed by warm bread with olive oil.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_19-10-34_155.jpeg)
Afterwards, an amuse bouche was served. I forgot exactly what it was, but it was good![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_19-16-23_001-1.jpeg)
For an appetizer, I selected the Arabic Mezze, which was good as usual. I also really appreciate the candle that is placed on the table. It adds a lot to the atmosphere.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_19-20-29_557.jpeg)
For my entrée, I selected the grouper. It was delicious, but as indicated by the pepper on top, quite spicy.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_19-41-03_570.jpeg)
Finally, for dessert, I went for the ice crease, which was really tasty.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_20-01-54_229.jpeg)
After dinner, I put the seat back and took a little nap. However, I woke up a little before landing, so I asked for the mini sliders. They were a good snack before landing![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-27_23-34-37_574.jpeg)
Shortly before landing, we were given a small box of chocolates, and landed in Doha less than 30 minutes behind schedule.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_01-15-21_408.jpeg)
