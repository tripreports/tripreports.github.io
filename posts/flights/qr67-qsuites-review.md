Being my first ex-Doha Qatar business class flight, I was pretty excited to visit the Al Mourjan lounge in Doha. Unfortunately, given how early the flight was, I didn't get as long as I would have liked. Nonetheless, I got the visit the restaurant and experience the lounge a little. The lounge is huge, and has many different areas. Upon first entering, I saw the beautiful water feature, which was right below the restaurant.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_19-45-42_778.jpeg)
Heading up the stairs takes you to the dining area, and given it was early, it was time for breakfast. I got a seat at the restaurant, and tried the smoothie and French Toast.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_20-01-06_008.jpeg)
Both were very good, but the portions were a little small. Afterwards, it was time to board,  and for this flight we used a bus to get to our gate. There was a separate bus for business class passengers, and boarding was easy. After getting on the plane, I was welcomed, and directed to seat 10K![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-29-38_471.jpeg)
As with all Qsuites, 10K has direct aisle access. However, 10K is a rear facing seat, which offers better privacy and views from the window. Waiting at my seat was a Diptyque amenity pouch (compared to the cardboard boxes you get when coming into Doha) stocked with the usual amenities from Qatar Airways.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-34-05_670.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-35-01_165.jpeg)
Shortly after getting to my seat, I was offered a welcome drink, for which I happily chose a mint lemonade. I was also given a refreshing towel.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-32-41_947.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-32-50_150.jpeg)
The seat controls offer a lot of options, as well as the option to set your seat to "Do Not Disturb" when you want to get some rest.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-36-42_406.jpeg)
In the compartment between the seat and the aisle I found the water bottle. And headset.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-36-11_671.jpeg)
A menu was distributed for the flight, and I was pleased to see a good range of food, despite it being a shorter, daytime flight.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-59-43_838.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_21-59-50_094.jpeg)
After all the passengers had boarded, we pushed back, and took off a little late. Shortly after, my table was set, and lunch service started with another mint lemonade and some nuts, as well as some warm bread and olive oil.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_22-33-36_357.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_23-03-31_521-1.jpeg)
Next, an amuse bouche was served![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_23-04-12_139.jpeg)
For my main course, I selected the Chicken Machboos. This is another plus of QR flights leaving Doha, which I think have better catering than inbound flights. The Chicken Machboos might be my favorite dish I've had on a Qatar, and possibly on a plane - very flavorful and rich.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_23-18-00_980.jpeg)
After that, I got some ice cream, which was well presented and tasty.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_23-31-47_739.jpeg)
To wrap up the meal, I asked for some Karak Chai with cardamom, which was delicious.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-28_23-46-11_861-1.jpeg)
After that, I put the seat back and enjoyed the Oryx One entertainment system, which has no shortage of movies to watch. Shortly before landing in Frankfurt, another round of refreshing towels was distributed, along with a small box of chocolates.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-01-29_05-59-13_846-1.jpeg)
Despite a slightly late departure, we landed 15 minutes ahead of time in Frankfurt.
