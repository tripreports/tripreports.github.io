When I was looking for a product to fly back to the US from Europe, I didn't want to end up in a 2-2-2 configuration. Since Swiss uses a staggered 1-2-2 configuration, I decided to try my luck with getting the so called "throne" seat. Having managed to select seat 16A (a throne seat) I was excited for the flight, but I woke up to a notification from Swiss that the flight had been delayed 5 hours. I later figured out this was due equipment failure on the 777 that was supposed to take us over, so they instead had to wait for a different plane. Luckily, the new plane they found was another 77W, so the equipment change didn't affect my seats. While checking out the different lounges in the Zurich airport, I received another notification that our flight was delayed again, meaning that we would be leaving 6 hours behind schedule. After a full day of lounge hopping at ZRH, we finally started boarding.![Swiss Business Class Cabin](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_10-04-12_281.jpeg?w=1024)
*Swiss Business Class Cabin*

I liked the way the cabin is designed - it looked very modern, with plenty of light highlights. I found my way to my seat, 16A![Seat 16A](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_09-40-11_957.jpeg?w=1024)
*Seat 16A*

The throne seats have a lot of room and storage on either side, which makes them the best choice of seat. Waiting at the seat was an amenity kit. The pouch folds out into a larger pouch, and the contents were standard and adequate.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_09-43-32_953.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_09-44-44_202.jpeg)
On one side, there is a hangar, headset, and bottle of water. On the bottom left of the panel is a button to release the tray table![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_09-47-06_568.jpeg)
As a pre-departure drink, I chose champagne, which was accompanied by a hot towel.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_09-51-12_784.jpeg)
A menu was also handed out for todays flight![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_10-42-02_596.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_10-42-07_662.jpeg)
After take off, the meal service started immediately. I had a screwdriver, and was given a bowl of nuts![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_11-00-40_319.jpeg)
During and for a little while after take off, I was working on a way to get my headphones to work. For some reason, the connection was quite loose, and I needed to rig up a contraption to get sound out of them![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_11-19-08_382.jpeg)
The bread course, salad, cheese, and appetizer all came out on one tray. I selected the carrot tatar, which I wasn't a huge fan of.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_11-35-38_158.jpeg)
Shortly after, the main course came out. I selected the chicken - which was tasty, and nothing special.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_11-58-54_323.jpeg)
For dessert, I chose the chocolate cake. As with the other catering - good, but nothing to write home about![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_12-08-59_018.jpeg)
After dinner, I put the seat back, and got some rest. I found the seat to be decent for sleeping, but the bedding to be lacking. The bedding is somewhere where Swiss needs to improve, especially compared to other products![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_12-54-01_917.jpeg)
After a good rest, I woke up before landing and enjoyed pre-landing meal. I really enjoyed it, and it was possibly my favorite meal on the flight![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_19-52-05_047.jpeg)
Unfortunately, to add to our delay, we got put into a holding pattern in SFO for about 30 minutes, and ended up landing 5 minutes short of 6 hours late. The flight, product, and service were all quite pleasant, and barring the delay, was nice experience.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-03_22-06-04_661.jpeg)

## **A Note on EU261**

Given the significant delay for this flight, it should be covered for compensation under the EU261 rules. Additionally, I did have to change my connecting flight in SFO, which cost more. I submitted a request for compensation shortly after the flight, which Swiss denied (although they could not substantiate why). So far, I have not yet received compensation for this flight.
