# EK412 First Class Review

**Date:** 10/17/2025
**Airline:** Emirates
**Flight Number:** EK412
**Aircraft:** A380-800
**From/To:** SYD-CHC
**Distance Flown:** 1,322 mi

To follow up my Singapore Suites flight, I figured why not try out another First Class on another A380. So I was able to find a seat on EK412 fifth freedom flight between SYD and CHC. I used the new premium cabin checkin and security at SYD, which was well appreciated and helped me speed through security. Although SYD has a Emirates lounge, I decided to use the Qantas First lounge, which is very highly rated. It didn't disappoint - the space is big and has amazing runway views. There is a la carte dining and they cooked me up a delicious breakfast.

When it was time board, I made my way to the gate to get back onto another A380-800. When I got the door, cabin crew were busy, so I just made my way to seat 3A myself

I was offered coffee and other beverages before takeoff, as well as dates. Since this was a pretty short flight, there would only be one meal service (with caviar) which, due to the timing of the flight, was breakfast. Due to the flight being a fifth freedom flight, I noted a few things. The cabin was pretty empty, as I assume most passengers got off at Sydney. I also think the cabin crew were the original crew who flew from DXB-SYD, meaning that they were on hour 20 or something of the "flight". I did notice service to be a little inattentive, but I cannot fault anyone, as I would be in a way worse state after such a long flight.

The seat was packed with amenities, from the pad of paper and pen in the desk to the famous minibar. No amenity kit was at the seat - I might have been able to get one on request but I didn't feel the need for it

IFE was somewhat convoluted to navigate, but I eventually found a live camera I could watch, which was perfect for me

After takeoff, the cabin crew started meal service. Both caviar and breakfast options (I had a mango chia bowl) were offered. Both were good, and I completely forgot to photograph either. A while after breakfast, I inquired as to whether the shower was available to use. To my excitment, it was - another bucketlist item for me. It took a few minutes to prepare, and when it was ready, an FA came to get me and show me the features of the shower suite. Just like the bathroom on SQ's A380, it was ridiculously spacious

All amenities, such as shampoo and shaving kits, are provided. Each shower is allocated at 5 minutes of water usage, and 20 minutes in the suite. I found both to be very sufficient

After the shower, I returned to my seat to enjoy the rest of the short flight, and we landed in CHC with a slight delay. Although I don't want to dismiss Emirate's first product at all, as it's quite luxurious, coming straight from Singapore's Suites did show just how different the first class products are. Again - not at all dismissive of Emirates, but Singapore wins in every category with the exception of the shower. Service was more attentive, and the seperation of the bed and seat is huge. Both are very private, which is great. That said, I absolutely would fly Emirates First again given the chance, and I would love to try the product out of Dubai.
