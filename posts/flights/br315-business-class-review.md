Eva Air Royal Laurel class has been on my list of products I wanted to fly for a while, but unfortunately I found it very hard to book a flight to and from the US. However, I noticed that there was a flight from Taipei to Brisbane, and jumped on the opportunity to book that. I was especially happy to see it was on Eva's new 787-10. Before the flight, I made sure to visit the Eva Air Infinity lounge. For a business class lounge, it was reasonably small, and had less food options that I have seen in some other business lounges. It was also quite crowded, and was a little hard to find seating. I didn't get many pictures of it, but I enjoyed an hour there, especially with the self serve Movenpick ice cream![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_16-54-44_537-1.jpeg)
When it was time to board, I made my way to the gate. Unfortunately, we had to board by bus and waiting for 5 minutes at the aircraft in the bus, as they finished refueling. Although I'm not a huge fan of remote gates, I do always enjoy seeing the plane from the tarmac![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_17-56-41_925.jpeg)
I was the first on the plane, and made my way to my seat, 3K![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-04-08_646.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-04-44_434.jpeg)
According to Seat Guru, all the window seats are the same, so I picked 3K. However, this isn't necessarily the case, and I found that odd rows, at least on the right side of the plane, have just a little more privacy, as their seats are close to the window. Waiting for me at my seat was the bedding, headphones, a bottle of water, slippers, a menu, and an amenity kit![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-05-17_478.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-05-21_051.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-06-28_831.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-08-12_176.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-08-18_245.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-08-20_766.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-09-03_367.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-09-48_188.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-21-13_644.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_20-08-04_888.jpeg)
I was offered a cold towel, chocolate, and a welcome beverage, which I chose the passion fruit juice, as I had enjoyed it on my flight the previous day![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_18-10-31_696.jpeg)
After takeoff, "dinner" was served. Unlike my short hop down to TPE the previous day, the courses came out separately, as there was adequate time. For my entrée, I selected the fried fish. It was good, tasty, but not on the level of some of my favorite plane meals.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_19-13-17_913.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_19-30-19_176.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_19-34-32_811.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_19-47-55_185.jpeg)![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_20-00-23_122.jpeg)
After dinner, pyjamas were distributed. I had heard a lot about the pyjamas on Eva, which are designed by Jason Wu, and was pleasantly surprised. They felt well made, and are comfortable. They do run a little small, though, so I was glad to get a large.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_19-02-26_469.jpeg)
The bathroom was well stocked and clean, and even had additional amenities, such as a toothbrush and ear plugs.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_20-10-49_047.jpeg)
Once all the passengers had finished their meal, the lights were dimmed, and the awesome star lights in the 787-10 were illuminated![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-11_21-16-11_427.jpeg)
I leaned my seat back and enjoyed the extensive list of movies on the IFE. I was quite full from dinner, so when I was offered a snack before landing, I passed, and instead opted just for some juice. After watching the sunset, we landed a little behind schedule in Brisbane![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-12_01-17-30_330.jpeg)
From all the reports I had heard, people really liked Eva's business class offering, and I can wholeheartedly corroborate that. From both my flights with them, service was top notch, and all the flight attendants were incredibly nice. Of course, the A330's 2-2-2 product is a little outdated, but they really make up for it with the 787-10's product. After these flights, Eva air has become one of my favorites, and I hope to be back soon.
