Virgin Atlantic, especially when it comes to hard product, has a big gap. It's flagship product on the A350 is competitive in the TATL market. The product on the 787 - not so much. It's dated and cramped. Nonetheless, I needed to get across the Atlantic from the west coast on pretty short notice, and it was this or economy, and especially with the price, I couldn't pass it up, even it the hard product wasn't the best. Boarding was a little chaotic, as it always is in the satelite terminal in SEA, but I made my way onto my plane and got to seat 10A

The cabin on the VS' 787-9 is pretty unique in that it's asymetric. On other airlines that have herringbone configuration, their cabins are usually asymetric. However, since the 787 is a smaller plane than other widebodies, things got a little creative, and thus one aisle serves two columns of seats, where the other serves only one column. If you can, definitely book a seat in the A column, as it's the most private in this cabin (which isn't saying much given how exposed the seats are)

Waiting at the seat was an amenity kit in a recyclable pouch. The contents were parsimonious, but everything appeared to have been more sustainable than other airlines, so I'll give them that

Before takeoff, I was offered a selection of a few different beverages, and I chose a juice as usual. There was also a (resealable) can of water waiting for me at my seat - another nice effort from Virgin to be more sustainable

Pyjamas were offered as well, which were comfortable, but definitely not the best I've gotten

One thing I did like to see was that every seat had individual air vents. This is great for me, as I usually run a little warm, and I find cabins can sometimes be overheated

The IFE, just as configured on Air New Zealand, pops out. It's a smaller screen, and so much of the housing is just the mechanics to make it work with the herringbone seat. I also found it to be a tad... provocative? ;)

Dinner was served quickly after takeoff, and started with a cocktail - I selected the Virgin Atlantic signature cocktail, which was quite good - made from gin and proseco.

Appetizers were not as exciting - caviar and vegetables, neither of which appealed to me on this flight

Dinner was better - chicken, barley, and squash. Dessert was also tasty, although I forgot to get a picture of it. I have yet to run into a dessert on an airplane which isn't

Shortly after dinner, I was offered turn down service. I found the bed to not be long enough for me (I am >6ft) and didn't have as restful a flight as I was hoping. However, seeing the aurora made up for it

I rested for the rest of the flight - given how short it was (just over 9hrs) I was still pretty full from dinner, and so I passed on breakfast. We arrived a few minutes early into London. Going into the flight, I had pretty low expectations for the hard product, especially coming from QSuites, Royal Laurel, and even Polaris. It's fair to say these expectations were met. On the plus side, cabin crew were super friendly, and the food was good. However, the hard product on the 787-9 is just old and need a revamp, especially when compared to VS' other planes. I look forward to trying Upper Class on an A350, but I don't think I'll be back on a 787-9
