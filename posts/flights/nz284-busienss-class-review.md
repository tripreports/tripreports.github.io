After United cancelled a flight out of AKL, I managed to get myself rebooked onto a similar flight to SFO with Air New Zealand. That was my third flight ever in business, so I didn't have much to go off of. It took me a few more flights to realize how outdated the product was. Still, I recall the service being incredibly friendly, so I knew on this flight to Singapore, I would at least be well taken care of. 

NZ's business class cabin, very similar to Virgin Atlantic, is arranged in a herringbone configuration. Very densly packed, and not private at all. However, for a daytime flight, I wasn't too worried about it. I arrived to the Auckland airport and headed to the premium check in area. Although slightly confusing in terms of layout, it made getting through security super fast.

After a visit to the ANZ business lounge, where I reminised on United cancelling my flight home a few years prior, I made my way to the gate. My seat for today was 2B - not a window, but the best I could do.

At my seat was an amenity kit in a recyclable pouch. Many of the amenities were equally eco friendly, which was nice to see. Controls for the seat are simple, perhaps too much so. Despite this, I recall having to get an FA to lay my seat fully flat on my flight a few years ago. Bedding is behind the headrest

On this flight as well, I found the service to be extremely friendly. If that's the most notable thing about Air New Zealand's business class, that's not the worst thing. Given the flight was about 10 hours, we would have two meal services. Shortly after takeoff, the first one started with an amuse bouche - something which is sometimes forgetten in business and was a nice touch

Next was the roast duck appetizer with bread. Nothing too notable

For my first meal, I selected the seared sea bass. I was disappointed that the lamb wasn't on the menu this flight, as I recall it being quite good on my previous one, but the sea bass was good

I've never seen an airline go wrong with dessert, and this was no exception. I selected a chocolate cake

After lunch, I leaned my seat back and watched some movies. Just like Virgin Atlantic, NZ's IFE screens pop out so they can be viewed while the seat is down, and fold back into the side when it's not. After a movie, I took a nap, and woke up shortly before landing. We were offered another meal - this time I selected the beef with potatoes. Not as good as the seabass, but fine.

The real star of the dining on the flight was second dessert - a spiced ginger cake. Not too sweet, with a really great taste. Was a great way to end of the dining on the plane

And with that, we touched down in Singapore. All in all, it was a pretty uneventful flight and matched up to my old experience. The hard product is outdated, and there's no two ways about it. ANZ is due for a refresh, and I'm excited to see what they come up with - paired with the great service I've observed, it could be a really nice product to a great destination
