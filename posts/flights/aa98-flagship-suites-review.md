As I was looking for flights to get myself to Europe, I was super excited to find a flight in AA's brand new flagship suites. And the icing on the cake: I was able to book myself a preferred suite. As this flight was scheduled to leave pretty late (10:30pm), I had a pretty long stay in the Flagship lounge in ORD. As business class lounges go, it wasn't my favorite - food options were limited, and there weren't a ton of amenities. Not bad by any means, just more similar to a clean, less crowded regular lounge. Originally, I had intended to stay there for around 10 hours (my hotel couldn't extend checkout any longer), but it ended up being longer as AA98 kept getting delayed. The plane runs originally from LAX, through ORD, to LHR. A delay in LAX and no buffer time in ORD meant that we ended up with a 2.5hr delay. Still, I was really glad they didn't cancel the flight, as I was really looking forward to trying the new business class configuration and didn't want to have that flight cancelled and rerouted on a route with old business class. Better late than never.

After finally getting on the plane close to 1am, I was able to see the brand new cabin. The seats with the black theme are preferred suites at bulkheads, which are pretty distinct from the other seats in the business class cabin. They have better bedding, amenities, and more room.

I also really liked the dark theme of everything

My seat was 10D - although I usually prefer the window, it wasn't available, and the choice between a non-preferred window and a preferred aisle was clear to me.

And here is the seat after moving all of the bedding

Amenity kits were in one of the storage bins at my seat

Unfortunately, when I flew this route, the FAA hadn't approved AA for the use of the suite doors, so all doors were locked open. It would have been nice to be able to use them, and I hope they get them approved quickly. Otherwise, I was pretty impressed with the suite. Especially in the preferred suites, there was a ton of room for storage. All the unused space in the suite had shelves or bins, and there was plenty of counter space too. I assume this is slightly less the case in the regular seats, but I was impressed at how expansive it was. I was also very happy to see that seats had individual air vents, which I'm a *big fan* of

Controls for the seat are pretty simple

I had my own individual power outlets as well

We were given menus, and given how short the flight was, all meal service would follow the "express" schedule. Given how tired I was at this point, I didn't have any issue with that. Drinks were served as the remaining passengers boarded, and we finally pushed back just after 1am.

All throughout the flight, I caught hints that the cabin crew were still learning the functionalities of the plane - anything from how the seats worked to where things were in the galley. Not saying this in any sort of negative way, but I found it really interesting as this is by far the newest product I've been on. A note about the galley - row 10 (and I would assume row 1), are right behind the galley, which isn't ideal for noise/light when trying to sleep. 

Shortly after takeoff, dinner was served - as mentioned, everything came on a single tray. Food was substandard, but I was tired and hungry at this point, so I didn't really care

The one thing that didn't come out originally was dessert, which was the highpoint

After dinner, I went to brush my teeth. The bathroom was spacious and clean

And when I returned, I had my seat converted into a bed. I have to say, with all the bedding, it was pretty comfortable. A little short, but otherwise a great bed

I slept through the rest of the flight and was woken up for breakfast. Similar to dinner, it wasn't very notable

Overall, I was pretty impressed with the new product. I've never flown any other business class on AA, so I don't have any basis to compare how much of a step up this is, but it's clear this is American being the first of the big three to revamp their business class. And in my opinion, they did a great job with the hard product. As is the case with all US catering, it doesn't compare to some foreign catering, but that's a problem that all US airlines will suffer from. However, looking at the seat alone, I was really impressed and would absolutely fly it again.

We arrived in London a little under 2.5 hours late - luckily, I had given myself plenty of time to self connect. I did note a lot of delays previously on this same route - indicating to me that AA has made the schedule too tight between LAX-ORD-LHR - hopefully they find a way to fix that
