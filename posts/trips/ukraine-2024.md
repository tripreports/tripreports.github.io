## Getting there
Given the war, getting into Ukraine is somewhat challenging. To get there, I flew into Krakow and took a bus. On the way in, there was a slight hold up at immigration. However, on the bus ride out, there was a big delay - about 4 hours. Made the connection between my bus and flight out of Krakow tighter than I would have liked

## Visa

Ukraine is Visa Free for US Passport

## Getting Around

As I was only visiting downtown Lviv, I used public transport and walked. Google Maps worked well for public transport. I used credit cards for public transport, and it worked fine

## The War
At the current time, Ukraine is at war with Russia. Although I initially thought it would be in poor taste to visit, I had wanted to go, and I figured more tourist money in the country would actually be, in the smallest way possible, of assistance in their effort to defend their territory. Regardless, I was visiting the city furthest from the front lines (Lviv)

## Day 1
My bus arrived in Lviv near the train station. I took the trolley to the downtown to my hotel (Hotel Lviv). I got checked in quickly as the sun was starting to set

I headed out for sunset. I walked through the old town to a view point of the city, and caught sunset over the city

## Day 2
My full day in Lviv. I got packed up and checked out of my hotel, and left my bag in storage for the day. My first stop was the House of Scientists - a well preseved old mansion. An interesting stop, but not memorable

From there I headed back to the old town, starting with the Armenian Quarter

The old town has some really well preserved pastel colored houses, which make for a very colorful stroll

After spending a few hours there, I headed up to [this cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iwtgsZaiNPEsjciR8) via St. George's Cathedral. Both were great stops, although I didn't go inside the second one.

From there, I headed up to the Shevchenkivskyi Hai Park Museum - an outdoor museum with a bunch of "exhibits" - essentially, restored 18th century houses, where each one indicates an 18th century profession and how it was performed. Everything from carpentry, woodworking, pottery, and fishing. I spent a few hours here, until it got time to head back to the hotel to get my bag.

I went back through the Opera House square, got some food, grabbed my bag from the hotel, and headed to the bus station to catch my bus back to Krakow

## Impressions
I had originally wanted to visit Kiev as well on this trip, however due to the elimination of air travel, that would have made for another 7 hour bus ride, which I wasn't up for. I was definitely impressed with Lviv - the old town is beautiful, and there are a bunch of attractions around town. I'll happily visit Kiev when things have settled down (and hopefully in favor of the Ukrainian)
