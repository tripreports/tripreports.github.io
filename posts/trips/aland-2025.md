## Visa

Although autonomous, when push comes to shove the Åland Islands are a part of Finland. Thus, they are covered by the Schengen zone. Flying into them is challenging, and it's far more convenient and efficient to take a ferry. Ferries leave from Stockholm or Turku, meaning that once you arrive in the islands on the ferry, there is no real entry/exit control

## Getting There

As I had a few spare days in Sweden, I decided to take the ferry over from Stockholm. I sailed round trip with Viking Lines, booked through Direct Ferries. Both ferries left in the morning. On the way over, the trip took around 5.5hrs, and on the return interestingly it took 7h. Given the transit time, that meant I would have an afternoon on the 17th and the entire day on the 18th. I found this to be sufficient to see Mariehamn, espeically considering I had a slight cold and was moving slowly

## Day 1

The ferry arrived right on time, and getting out was easy. For my accomodation, I chose the Kronan Guesthouse, which was conveniently located to the ferry terminal - a 10 minute walk. Check in was easy, so I dropped my bags, rested, and headed out to the marina right behind the ferry terminal for a walk as the sunset. Given how far north the islands are, during the summer there is virtually no night - just a few hours every day. Thus, sunset is around 10:30pm.

Around the marina, there is also the Pommern. It's a museum ship which you can pay to enter, but also just walk around. I didn't feel particularly enticed to see the inside, but it's nice to walk around the outside and see it.

## Day 2

As this was my only full day, I wanted to see Mariehamn proper. Everything in the islands is very close, and so I found walking to be sufficient in getting around. Bikes are another great option, and it's definitely possible to rent them. I started out today by heading through town to the [park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E3p5mHGfvErBqQfJ8), which has a nice shaded promenade along the waterfront

I continued up along the waterfront along the bike/walking trails. There isn't a ton to see after the marina, but I was enjoying the sun. On the way back, I went through "downtown" Mariehamn, which has a few fun little attractions. The Åland sign that overlooks the water

A fun mailbox outside the main postoffice for the town

And my personal favorite, the sheep sign

Many of the houses appear to be old and well maintained, which makes walking around the downtown fun

Ready for a rest, I headed back for a few hours. As the sun started setting, I headed out for the last item on my list, the [watertower viewpoint](https://maps.app.goo.gl/37k5b4YpJRFFp2e48). This is a great place to catch sunset, and you don't have to worry about missing it given how drawn out it is this time of year

With that, I headed back to my guesthouse. I definitely wouldn't call Mariehamn my most adventurous or interesting destination, but I did find it to be quite peaceful and relaxed, which is exactly what I needed to burn a few extra days. I'm not sure I would return only to see Mariehamn, but if I came back with a car to explore the rest of the islands, that would be interesting.
