## Visa

As is the case with most things tourism related in Kuwait, it's not well documented. On a US passport, my understanding was that Kuwait would be visa on arrival, which it is. However, instead of issuing the visa at the immigration counter, like VOA normally is, I had to go to the seperate Visa office. There was a ton of people waiting in there, so I was worried that I would get caught up in a line that would take hours, but I took a number, made my own photocopy of my passport (again, a new one for me) and was called almost instantly. They granted the visa there, I headed back down to the immigration counter, and made it through without issue. At this point it was about 10pm on the 7th. I withdrew cash in the airport, wasn't able to get Careem to work, so I took a taxi to my hotel for 8KWD, which I think was fair and the going rate

## Getting There

I had some spare time between Socotra and Jordan, so I decided to stop over in Kuwait for a day. Flights are easy - in on Etihad and out on Kuwait Airways 

## Day 1

My flight in arrived in the evening on the 7th and my flight out left in the morning on the 9th, giving me only one day. I had a slow start, and pulled my usual trick of waiting out the hottest part of the day. 

In the morning, I walked around Al Shaheed park, which was right by my hotel. I actually had a good time, the park is well maintained, has a bunch of shade and some art and fountains scattered around. Little did I know, this likely was the highlight of the day

As things started to cool off in the afternoon, I grabbed a Careem to the Souq, where I started my one day tour

After walking around the souq for a while, I headed towards my next stop - the national museum. If there anything entertaining in gulf countries to do, its their national museum. Qatar's got a great one, I enjoyed one in Bahrain after my initial plans fell through. I walked over there from the souq, and spent about 30 minutes trying to find an entrance. There were open doors where I was able to enter the building, but it became pretty clear that everything was under construction. After finding a worker and asking, it became clear that it wasn't open. Nothing online pointed to this, but see my previous point about things not being well documented for visitors

At this point, I was pretty out of options, as there really isnt too much to do and I was too late to go to some of the other museums, especially if there were in the same state. Thus, I decided to walk back along the waterfront as the sunset

The walk took me past the royal palace, the dhow harbor, and the iconic Kuwait Towers, which by the time I reached, the sun had fully set

Another unexpected highlight of Kuwait was finding all the American fast food brands scattered around, with a Canes at the waterfront. I couldn't resist

And that was it. Definitely, there were museums I didn't visit further out of the city, but apart from that, there really is nothing to do in Kuwait. It's the gulf country that has made zero effort into developing it's tourist infrastructure, and it shows. Everything is safe, easy to get around, but it just seems like they have no interest in attracting visitors. I stopped in just to check it out, but I'm glad I didn't spend more time here and really, I could have planned a daytime layover like I did in Bahrain and been fine with that.
