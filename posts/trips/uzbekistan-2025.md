# Uzbekistan 9 Day Trip Report

**Date:** 2025-10-03-2025-10-12
**Country:** Uzbekistan

---

## Getting there
I flew into Tashkent from Doha, and flew out from Tashkent to Kuala Lumpur. Both flights were late night, with the outbound being a redeye. Flights to this region are rarely daytime flights, I would assume given how departure banks work with surrounding airports in the Gulf and Asia

## Visa

One of the more tedious visa processes I've encountered. Getting your images accepted is particularly challenging, and I would recommend referring to [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Uzbekistan/comments/15m4ng0/how_to_get_past_the_passport_and_photo_section_of/) which worked well for me. After I submitted it, they took the full 3 business days to process it

## Getting Around

Getting around in Uzbekistan is surprisingly easy, given the train network. You can take the train from Tashkent all the way out to Khiva, transfer to Nukus, and fly back to Tashkent, which is what we did. Train ticket sales have a clear window, and it's important to observe it as they do sell out.

Taxis are everywhere, but as we learned at the airport, getting a good price is hard. Yandex is basically a Russian Uber, and makes taxis extremely cheap. Most drivers don't speak english. Metro is Tashkent is another great way to get around. Google Maps doesn't work well, but Yandex does in transport mode

## Languages
The majority of tourists are Russian and Chinese, so English is not very common. The translate app was used frequently, so make sure you have connection. We noted that not everyone, espeically the older population, could read the translated Uzbek from the screen. If it seems this is the case, use the verbal translate feature

## Day 1 - Tashkent
Our flight arrived at 1am, so we were already pretty tired. Immigration was suprisingly easy, but finding cash was a challenge. And as soon as we exited the airport, we were swarmed with taxi drivers. Our very friendly host in Tashkent had reached out earlier and indicated that we should be paying no more than 50k SOM for both of us for a taxi from the airport to the apartment. The first offer we received was 300k. It was clear that staying around the exit to the airport wouldn't yield good results, so we went further out into the parking lot. We weren't clear on whether you can use Yandex from the airport, as in other countries give into the pressure from the airport taxi mafia and allow them to keep their monopoly. For future reference, **you can** But after asking multiple drivers and getting prices that were well out of range, we found ourselves in an almost humorous argument over price when an offduty airport staff member overheard us and offered to take us to Amir Temur square (which is right by our apartment) for 40k (for both) as he was heading that way anyway. We gave him 50 for the ride, as he was also a guide and gave us some good recommendations. This made it so we got to our apartment around 3am. Although the plan was to sleep in, the Uzbek alam clock (construction in the unit next door) kicked and and I couldn't sleep past 9am. After sorting out breakfast, we got going on our one day in Tashkent

First stop was the Chorsu Bazaar, which is one of the biggest open air markets I've seen. It's pretty well divided up into sections of produce, bakery, meats, spices, etc. I didn't buy anything, but it was really fun to walk around, and a good way to start the trip
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/chorsu.jpeg)

From there, just across the street is [Said's Ceramics](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pibc3RkDb3BqFZCt5) which is a nice stop to see some of the traditional ceramics in various states of being made
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/pottery.jpeg)

We walked from there to the Hazrati Imam Complex, which was still under construction at the time. It was possible to enter for free - I'm not sure if it's a paid attraction or not. A guard mentioned we needed to pay 60k to go into a building, but we opted out. The complex itself is pretty expansive, with a mosque in the upper courtyard, as well as a large registan in the lower one
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54846774751_da2382838a_b.jpg)

From there, we used Yandex to get to Tashkent Tower. This is an old soviet TV tower. Walking around it was interesting, but I can't recommend making a detour for this - it's out of the way, and not particularly interesting

Next stop was the Chor Minor Mosque, another attraction that didn't really impress. It's also an active mosque, which feels a little weird to visit

For dinner, we went to Besh Qozon, which is right by the Tashkent Tower. My first, and only, experience with Plov
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/plov.jpeg)

## Day 2

Coming directly from Qatar sets an extremely high bar for museums. There was some spare time before our train to Samarkand today, so we visited the State Museum of the Temurids. As we found to be the case with many of the museums in Uzbekistan, many of the pieces appear to be replicas - otherwise the date them from when they were discovered. There's interesting history, and it was a good visit, but didn't feel very well planned

The train to Samarkand left from Tashkent South station, which is an important distinction as there are multiple stations in Tashkent. Our ever helpful host helped to confirm this. Upon boarding the train, we were showed to a first class cabin by the conductor, who spoke no english, and immediately demanded money. It became clear that he wanted a bribe to go to a better seat, which we turned down, and went to our seats we booked. The train was about an hour late. Upon exiting the station at Samarkand, there was the usual group of taxi drivers asking where they could take you, but less aggresive and dense than in Tashkent. We walked a short way out, called a yandex for under 30k, and got checked in to the hotel. It was almost sunset, so we headed over the Registan Square
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847092770_daf3104de9_b.jpg)

## Day 3 - Samarkand

A full day in Samarkand. First stop was Registan Square (again). Today, we actually purchased an entrance ticket. Entrance tickets are 100k for standard tourists, and are single entry only. As we had walked around the gate of the square the prior evening, we were offered a bribe at one of the back entrances to get in, so it may be possible to find that cheaper. Luckily, when we entered in the morning after purchasing tickets, the tickets were only checked, and not scanned. Registan square is comprised of three registans - each courtyard has shops in it, which somewhat ruin the atmosphere. There could be at least one that's empty.

When looking at the square from the main viewing point, I had read it was possible to climb the far minaret of the left registan, and you had to pay a shopkeeper. We found this shopkeeper, Ali. To find him, go into the right entrance of that left registan, and his is the first shop as you go down the stairs. Reports from not long ago said they had been able to go up for 15k, so when he said 100k, we tried to negotiate and were turned down. The square is by far the most popular attraction in Samarkand, so it makes sense that locals have gotten wise to how much tourists are willing to pay
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847032538_eb0881a119_b.jpg)

Next stop was the Bibi Khanym Mosque and Mausoleum. Right as we got there, a massive tour group was entering the mosque, so we decided to come back later. We headed over the Mausoluem, where they indicated it was 50k to enter. We were able to glance inside, and it didn't look like anything special, so we turned around. 
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847032218_b966ef8b62_b.jpg)

There is a good view, however, of the mosque from the courtyard of the Mausoleum
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847032233_73bf7481e0_b.jpg)

Next stop was the Makhsum Baba Mausoleum, a short walk from Bibi Khanym. Not as grand as other attractions, but entrance was free. From there, we walked through the graveyard following this path
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/path.png)

It's important that once you hit a gate by the 4th red indicator, stick to the left and stay high. The gate is locked, but you can continue going around if you stay in the graveyard. This gives some really cool views down into the Shah-I-Zinda complex
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847032238_b36bf37193_b.jpg)

And you can also get to the hill there to get a good glimpse of the path so far through the city
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847031913_8367909172_b.jpg)

On the map through the graveyard, where the arrow is at the end, indicates a rooftop with a small dropoff. It's possible to enter the compound for free there - whether you do or don't is up to you. It's pretty out of the way and one could tag onto a passing tour group. But in no way indicating that's what we did...

The complex itself is beatiful, very colorful with arches very densly packed. People very densly packed as well
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54846774081_075cb60611_b.jpg)

But it may have been my favorite stop in Samarkand
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847032213_c6f4cc944a_b.jpg)

From there, we headed back through the graveyard to get to the Alfrasiyab ruins. This has a museum which is paid, but you can enter for free. And we soon figured out why - its pretty much a dud, and there really isn't anything there. It's exposed, so hot, and very dusty. Onto the next stop. We headed through that grassy/dusty field to the [this pin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stairs+to+the+Cemetery+on+the+cliff/@39.673189,66.9933702,296m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x3f4d189ee87f0c19:0x13cf0d2094a98df4!2sKhoja+Daniyor+Mausoleum!8m2!3d39.673311!4d66.994506!16s%2Fg%2F121c4vk8!3m5!1s0x3f4d198c75b6cdc5:0xcbfe3ddee5be8f06!8m2!3d39.6729831!4d66.9938769!16s%2Fg%2F11y34wmv4s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). That's a back entrance to the Khoja Daniyor Mausoleum where you can enter for free.

From the Mausoleum, we headed to the Ulugbek Observatory - again when we showed up, there was a couple big groups just getting there. We were able to catch a glance of it, but after seeing how crowded it was, we decided to skip it and head back to the Bibi Khanym Mosque. That was a good call, as it was super empty when we returned. Definitely worth the visit and entry fee, just not when it was crowded earlier in the day
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847031508_cedd33c0e0_b.jpg)

From there, with a quick stop for snacks, we headed back to Registan Square as the sun was getting low in the sky. Since our ticket was never scanned in the morning, we still had an entry, which we happily used. The low light illuminates the buildings nicely
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54846773656_39f814060c_b.jpg)

Our nemesis, Ali, was gone, leaving his son in charge of his shop, who we managed to haggle down to 70k per person. Climbing the minaret is tight with a lot of stairs, but its absolutely worth it. Even at the price of 100k, it would be worth it. The views from the top are amazing, and I think sunset is a perfet time to go up
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847093290_fc2025e79a_b.jpg)

On the way up or down, when you get to the 2nd floor, make sure to poke your head out to get a good view of the courtyard
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847031833_987d9f6a2d_b.jpg)

Staying after dark means you can enjoy the different color lights they shine on the registans
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/lights.jpeg)

## Day 4 - Shahrisabz

Having seen just about everything in Samarkand, and having another full day, we did a day trip to Shahrisabz. A driver for the day cost us $60 USD. The drive over is about 2 hours. First stop was the Ak-Saray Palace. What I liked about this is that it hasn't undergone restoration, so you can see it in it's crumbling, original form. Not as picturesque as the restored registans (just above every other registan is restored) but definitely more historical and interesting
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847022104_cea9c424e3_b.jpg)

It's hard to get lost in Shahrisabz - from the palace just continue down the center line. You'll see the statue of Amir Temur. Along the way, there is a center for arts and crafts. It was pretty shut down, but there was a place where several women were making carpets, who were on their lunch break. We gestured if it would be okay to have a look at their workshop, and they said yes. On the way out, they invited us for tea and snacks. They didn't speak any English, but we enjoyed some tea and bread, then continued on our way. There are a few museums along the center line, but being pretty unimpressed with the museums so far, we passed and continued on towards the end. 

Kok Gumbaz Mosque might be my favorite in Shahrisabz. It has a few cool Mausoluems with nice paintings on the roof
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847021964_2c0139dd5d_b.jpg)

And a nice courtyard
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54846773581_ebd2114e04_b.jpg)

Across the way is the crypt of Amir Temur, which was our final stop. Another nice courtyard, with the supposed burial place of Amir Temur
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54845916387_e8c632a47b_b.jpg)

On the way back to Samarkand in the evening, we stopped at the viewpoint along the way
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/viewpoint.jpeg)

We had our driver drop us off at the Gur-i-Amir complex in Samarkand, the other supposed burial place of Amir Temur. Obviously, we were taken for a ride at one of the locations, at least. Hopefully not both. The complex itself is more impressive from the outside, but also has a small museum on the inside. It's worth seeing the museum, which is included with entrance, as it shows what the original structure looked like. When they restored it, they only restored the central part of it
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847092935_e291df1302_b.jpg)

## Day 5 - Samarkand to Bukhara

This was mostly a transit day. Our train was in the morning, which took a few hours. The Bukhara trainstation is also pretty far from the actual city of Bukhara. The Yandex was under $2 USD for a 45 minute ride - second hand smoke included. We arrived early enough in Bukhara to visit the Sitori-i-Mokhi Khosa palace in the evening. It was entirely unimpressive, although it did have free roaming peacocks. Given how far out of the city it is, it's definitely not worth it

## Day 6 - Bukhara

Our goal of the day was to arrive at the Bukhara Ark, the first stop for the day, early enough that the crowds wouldn't be there yet. Turns out, others had that idea too. The ark is an old walled, elevated city. Half is restored in a pretty unimpressive manner, and the other half are ruins which you can walk around. Some are actually pretty prominent, which was more interesting. In the shady, restored section, there are plenty of museums, which were some of the better quality ones. And there are a bunch of friendly cats.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847021699_cbcc8ca01f_b.jpg)

Next stop was the Bolo Hauz Mosque, which is right across the way. And after, the Chashmai Ayub Mausoleum. Both were pretty unimpressive stops. Things started to turn around as we hopped across the steet from the Mausoleum to the central bazaar. It was authentic like the Chorsu Bazaar in Tashkent, and pretty expansive. Plenty of stuff for sale
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847021779_375924f8d9_b.jpg)

From there, we headed over to walk the wall of Bukhara. It's similar contruction to the Ark, but with no tourists in site. We wrapped around from there to an [old soviet amusement park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Park+Attraktsionov/@39.776331,64.3992391,151m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x3f50089bf502ddc7:0xc038ea38fa92e2ee!2sCentral+Bazaar!8m2!3d39.779488!4d64.4009516!16s%2Fg%2F11g6xw8lw8!3m5!1s0x3f5009000a3848c7:0xf06c8dedd88e0827!8m2!3d39.7760581!4d64.3985574!16s%2Fg%2F11vsp5y7pb?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D) which was, for the most part, not operational.

The Ismail Samani Mausoleum was next - just like in Samarkand, there was an attendant who said entrance was 15k. We glance inside, and there was nothing, and the attendant didn't look official at all, so it seemed like it might have been someone who had just installed themselves there trying to collect a little money. The construction is interesting, but it's far better from the outside anyway
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847031368_16104dbdf3_b.jpg)

From there, we headed to the Zhdushchey Materi, which was a quick stop and onto Abdullakhan Madrasah. These are in the process of being restored, but it makes it so no one is there. You can freely walk around one, but the other is closed off

After that, we turned around and made our way back to the main/downtown part of Bukhara. This is where the main tourist area is, and they've turned many of the old building into art exhibits. This made for an interesting change
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847031353_e357c70e35_b.jpg)

All within a short radius, you can get to Caravansarai Ulugbek Tamakifurush, Lyabi Khause Square, and the Chor Minor monument. It's possible to climb, for around 30k. Neither the monument or it's roof are standouts, but for 30k I'm not complaining. As the sunset, we headed to Khoja Kalon, which has a very nicely maintained minaret, and another Madrash
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847033053_c0cd17a31f_b.jpg)

Last stop for the day was Zindan, which shows a dungeon. It was a fun stop. On the way back, we went back to the see the Kalon minaret lit up
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847023349_fb19af7515_b.jpg)

## Day 7 - Bukhara to Khiva

Most of this day was transit, as the train between Bukhara and Khiva is the longest of the three. We arrived in the late afternoon, but didn't want to spoil anything as there isn't a ton to do in Itchan Kala

## Day 8 - Khiva/Itchan Kala

Itchan Kala is the name for the walled city in Khiva. 
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54846775096_0235941c7b_b.jpg)

It is not large by any means, and takes about 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, on the long side. It is packed with monuments, but given how densly everything is packed together, a full day is plenty here at a pretty leisurly pace. You can enter the walled city for free through [this gate](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Itchan+Kala+East+Gate/@41.3768253,60.3618462,343m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x41dfa411a8e50c73:0x3920d4663f44b9c6!2sItchan+Kala!8m2!3d41.3780695!4d60.35933!16s%2Fg%2F1tgnvscw!3m5!1s0x41dfa411e8cfe11d:0xe49fb21dc2943f02!8m2!3d41.3770928!4d60.3624008!16s%2Fg%2F122vrf41?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), or you can supposedly get in for free if you're staying at a guesthouse in the city, which we were. However, to get into the museums/attractions, you need a museum pass which is 200k for 2 days and includes entrance to the city. There is a hidden option for 100k for a entrance ticket to the city which doesn't include entrance to the attractions, which is essentially useless since you can get in for free. Don't get that one. When you buy a ticket, you'll get a map with all the ~20 stops. They're all worthwhile and doable in a day, and I won't go through each. 
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847094460_f303c1e1da_b.jpg)

It's possible to climb the Islam Khoja Minaret, and this is worth it also. On the way up, you get good views out into the city
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54847023184_bb440c69dc_b.jpg)

You get an official ticket for this one, unlike in Samarkand. When we bought ours in the morning, we asked if we could go up then, and then also at night. The woman didn't speak much english, but waved us on, so under a liberal interpretation, we returned with our ticket at night and were allowed through.

There are also two walls that you can pay to go up on, at the gates. However, if you go to the [cemetary here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+West+Cemetery/@41.3757689,60.3565147,51m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x41dfa411a8e50c73:0x3920d4663f44b9c6!2sItchan+Kala!8m2!3d41.3780695!4d60.35933!16s%2Fg%2F1tgnvscw!3m5!1s0x41dfa41aa5a02be9:0x4f2f1fde6657cc09!8m2!3d41.375757!4d60.3565211!16s%2Fg%2F11dfts6942?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), you can just walk up onto the walls

## Day 9 - Fortresses, Nukus, Tashkent

Our last day started early in Khiva. There is a really convenient flight that worked well for this itinerary from Nukus, one of the furthest cities from Tashkent, to Tashkent in the afternoon, allowing us to have a leisurly connection to our flight to Malaysia. To get there, we hired a driver to take us to Nukus, by way of the 4 fortresses. These are some of the older artifacts in Uzbekistan, and was something I was really looking forward to. We elected to start at 5:30am in Khiva, having overestimated the time we would take, and found that we had extra time. We easily could have started at 7 or 8am and been fine, but this did mean we were first to Ayaz Kala, and had it to ourselves for sunrise. By far, this was the most impressive one. The driver dropped us off [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/irksoSExLQtHgFz69) which allowed us to walk up to "Ayaz Kala 1" which is a bigger fortress, in worse shape than the real Ayaz Kala. Still, it provides a great view over Ayaz Kala
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54848598207_69f3584382_b.jpg)

On the way back after visiting Ayaz Kala 1, we asked if we could make a detour to the smaller fortress we were overlooking, which was totally worth it. 

Between fortress 1 and 2, we stopped at a lake - which was suprising at how unimpressive it was. Perhaps a bigger deal in a landlocked country, I didn't find much of interest here. The remaining fortresses weren't as interesting, with the exception of the last one, which served as a sky burial site. On the highway between the last fortress and Nukus, there's an old airport and plane. I was too slow to ask him to pull off there, but it would have made for a nice stop. It's [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Plane+Nukus/@42.3828946,59.9470865,4149m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sayaz+kala!3m5!1s0x41dd8b00561e0cb3:0xd25eba42c223d281!8m2!3d42.3888055!4d59.9543033!16s%2Fg%2F11x7dp0zzw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3MUgBUAM%3D). We got dropped off at the airport in Nukus directly, and boarded our flight to get back to Tashkent
![](images/trips/uzbekistan-2025/plane.jpeg)

Arriving in Tashkent we flew into the domestic terminal, which was hilariously disconnected from the international terminal. The only way to get between them is walk (about an hour) or take a taxi (10 minutes). Of course, many taxi drivers offered outrageous prices, the worst being $20 USD. We laughed, booked a Yandex, and told him we had a private helicopter coming to get. The Yandex cost less than a dollar

## Impressions
Uzbekistan had been on my list for a long time, and I was originally supposed to visit in April of 2024, but my visa took too long to process and I wasn't able to go. The main attraction to the country is the sights - the registans and madrashs in each city. Knowing that most of them had been restored made it feel more like an art museum, so I was glad to be able to see some that weren't in Shahrisabz and Bukhara. Museums were, for the most part, unimpressive. We also got tired of each place charging an entry fee - I would far prefer a setup like I've found in Cyprus or Jordan where you can buy one pass to everything.

Cash is still very important, so make sure to carry plenty. Every apartment, guesthouse, or hotel wanted us to pay in Som or USD (or Euros). There were functional ATMs in all the cities. I had previously understood that ones out of Tashkent were unreliable, but that wasn't something we found

Very important is the registration. Every place you stay you will need to get registration, or proof that you stayed there. Everywhere should know what you're talking about. Usually it's a printed paper but our last accomodation gave us a stamped post it note. We were not asked for it on exit, but sometimes people are and when they don't have it it creates a mess, usually ending in a fine

The food in Uzbekistan is abysmal. No flavor and extremely fatty. Food poisoning is also very common. My favorite was Manti - a steamed bun with ground meat in it. Simple, and had it all 3 nights in Samarkand [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KC3aJzd3jpfWLxGX9)

People were generally friendly - anyone close to the tourist industry knows they can usually squeeze money out of people so taxi drivers, shop owners, etc will all try to highball you. This is why Yandex is so helpful. Otherwise, people are generally nice

Uzbekistan is somewhere I'm happy to have gone, I enjoyed the trip, and I have now no interest in going back. There's no real nature - it's mostly a desert, and so having seen the sights, I feel like I'm happy with that. I'll definitely return to central asia, but not Uzbekistan necesarily. But that's not to say the country isn't worth visiting - just that it's likely only worth visiting once.
