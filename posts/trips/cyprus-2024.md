## Visa

Cyrpus is Visa Free for US Passports

## Getting There

Larnaca is well connected. I flew in from Vienna and out to Munich. Part of the country is under ocupation (TRNC). It's very important to not enter or exit from there, as those stamps aren't recognized. To visit, arrive to Larnaca, and cross the landborder, then depart again from Larnaca

## Getting Around

I rented a car. Originally, I had booked through Budget. Upon showing up, they stated I needed an IDP, which I don't believe was true. Working with them was a dead end, so I cancelled and rebooked with Aerocar. They were far more pleasant and didn't need an IDP

## Day 1 - Larnaca

After immigration and the mess with the rental car and getting to my hotel, I didn't have much of an afternoon. I headed to Cape Greco, to walk around and enjoy the coastline

## Day 2 - Lefkara, Lofou

Before getting on my way from Larnaca, I stopped at the salt lake and Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque (they're right next to eachother). The mosque is modest, and I wasn't dressed approriately to enter as I was wearing shorts. There are a bunch of friendly stray cats around, though, which made up for it

The salt flats are cool, you can walk out on them. In some places, the salt crust isnt thick and your foot will sink into the mud

After seeing that, I started to make my way up into the mountains. My first stop was Sha Mine Lake, at an (abadoned?) mine. The colors make it a really cool, and it's well worth the stop

Next stop was Lefkara, a super sleepy mountain village. I spent a good few hours here as I loved the atmoshphere. I parked in this lot [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KEZxknSbiXcriq3S8) and would recommend doing so. I encountered multiple people who had attempted to drive and park in the village itself. One got going down a road that got narrower and narrower and needed help getting back to the real road, the other had forgotten where she had parked her car. Using the lot at the edge of town saved me from both those issues. From there, I walked the entire village. They alleys are great

On the way to the next stop, I noticed some really cool terrace farming on an opposing hill

Next stop was Lofou - where I was met with the same exact atmosphere. On the way into town, there is a similar parking lot [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JSfbzfAAy2xXixY67). Again, I would recommend using it

After doing the exact thing of just wandering the streets for a while in Lofou, I headed down the hill to Limassol, where I would spend the night. I made a quick trip over to see Kolossi Castle, which was closed when I was there, so I was only able to see it from the outside

## Day 3 - Mountains
At sea level during the summer in Cyprus, temepratures are high. But heading up into the mountains cools things off quick, which is why I was excited to head up to Troodos National Park. The first stop for the day was the Millomeris Waterfall Trail. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was pretty much a dud. From there, I headed all the way up to the peak of Mt. Olympos. In the winter, this gets snow and it's possible to ski. In the summer, the weather is perfect, sunny with a warm breeze, but not too hot. I tried to go up to the summit, but the top is a restricted miliatary site, and I was turned away. Instead, I parked my car [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qUduUx9pVrTKhdNT8) and walked around. The forest reminded me of a forest on the west coast at altitude.

From there, I continued to the Kykkos Monastary. It's free to enter, and has a lot of art to admire

Next stop was the Throni Shrine, which is incredibly secluded and picturesque

Last stop for the day was the Cedar Forest. Similar to Troodos NP, it's beatiful to drive through but sort of a duplicate. After that, I headed back downhill to Paphos for the night

## Day 4 - Paphos
Most of the monument in Cyprus cost money to enter, but Cyprus has an all you can visit historical monument pass. Thus, I purchased a day and stacked up all my historical visits to this day. I started out in Paphos, where I went to the parking lot [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wG2CciwvuAZjCtiV8)

First stop was Nea Paphos, which I prioritized early in the day as it's mostly out in the open. Most of the ruins are pretty worn down, but the best part are the mosaics

There is also a nice lighthouse above the amphitheatre

Right next to Nea Paphos is Paphos castle. Perhaps more impressive from the outside, it's also included on the pass so I popped in for a quick look. There really isn't anything inside of interest

From there, I headed north to the Tomb of the Kings
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54608052264_cdf97e0ddf_b.jpg)

Tomb of the Kings is a must visit, and after a good visit there I took a detour to fly over a shipwrecks thats visible from there

Once I was good with that, I headed east out of Paphos to Kourion. The main attraction here is the amphitheatre, but there is also a good collection of ruins a short walk from the theatre

From there, I headed to the Choirokoitia Neolithic Settlement - a UNESCO site. It's broken up into a restored segment, and then you can view the archeological site as well. I have to say, I was pretty unimpressed with the archological site - the history is absolutely interesting, but there's really nothing to see but rocks at the site

From there, I started heading back, with a stop at Aphrodities Rock, to the Monastery of Saint Neophytos. More friendly cats and a very calm atmosphere here
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54607859276_cc2df2f571_b.jpg)

Finally to wrap up the day, I headed to the wreck of Erdo III for sunset, which was perfect

## Day 5 - Larnaca
Although I had planned a few minor stops on the way back to the airport today, I was pretty exahausted and elected to sleep in. I returned the car to the lovely people at Aercar, and headed to the airport to get on my way

## Impressions
I had very few expectations for Cyprus, so I was going in mostly blind with a really rough itinerary - a lot of the stops were something that I saw on the side of the road and thought looked cool. It may be for that reason that it ended up being such a winner, but I really enjoyed my time there. I found a perfect mix of nature, history, and sleepy mountain towns to make the trip

Driving was mostly civilized, with the exception of driving on the wrong (left) side. Cities were a little busy but the mountain roads were super empty

I would definitely return to Cyprus - I'd love to see more, especially in the north. But just going back to some of the places I went would be nice.
