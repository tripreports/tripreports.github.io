# Jordan 5 Day Trip Report

**Country:** Jordan

## Getting there
Amman is a well connected airport and getting there is no challenge. I flew in from Kuwait, but there are so many direct flights - even from North America

## Visa
Jordan does do VOA for US Passports, but it's far more beneficial to get the Jordan Pass (I got the Petra 3 day, which was worth it) which also pays your visa fees. When you get to Amman, there's a Jordan Pass desk right before immigration to show them the pass, and they'll give you your visa. Immigration was easy - customs a little less so, as I was travelling with a drone. I didn't want to have it confiscated, and given I was flying in and out of Amman I had it seized by customs. I ended up going to hand it over to the Jordanian border security/intelligence, which was an adventure. I was given a form and was able to retrieve it on my way out easily. After getting it back, I was escorted up to check in and security and sent on my way. At security they detected it and freaked out - 5 agents came over to me thinking I had smuggled it into the country. I showed them the form, told them to call the people and once they did it got cleared up instantly. Good to have friends at border security...


## Getting Around

I rented a car from the Amman airport. The whole process was super easy. It cost $115 USD for the week which I think was really fair

## Safety
With the war going on so close to Jordan's borders, I think some people might be scared away. I felt totally safe and I highly doubt that Jordan would enter that war, or that anyone would attack Jordan - there's little benefit in doing so. However, the combination of the war, and the fact it was Ramadan, made it so prices and crowds were low 

## Day 1 - Amman
Having arrived in Amman the night before, I only had time to get my car and get to my hotel. I walked around a little at night as the streets were pretty lively, but my first real day way 03/10. Amman is a big city, but the two main attractions I wanted to see and had time for were the Citadel and the Roman Theater. Both are included on the Jordan Pass

Both of them are Roman ruins, although the citadel is interesting because it also has a mosque. The citadel is located on top of a hill and has a great panorama of the city

The mosque in the compound also has a very unique wood dome which I found interesting

The Roman theater is interesting too, but frankly better viewed from the citadel's view. But since it's included on the pass, no reason not to check it out

## Day 2 - Jerash
Jerash is a good daytrip from Amman - it's not a far drive, and it's 100% worth it (especially since it's on the pass). I found it a little hard to find the official parking lot. I had parked in a little lot on the side of the road, where someone approached me saying I had to pay him to park. I immediately saw through it as a scam, and left the car there while I walked around. The official, free, parking lot for Jerash is [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c5YS6Z6QMXLsdqCC8).

I spent a few hours walking around Jerash - the sheer size of it beats out the other ruins I've seen.

On one end, a group of shepherds was moving their flock through, which added to the atmosphere

At sunset, I also went up to visit Rainbow Street to see the lanterns. It's a little hard to find, but they were hung [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hN84CaCARm9eqFGe6)

## Day 3 - Dead Sea, Karak, Petra
Mostly a driving day. I left Amman in the morning and routed myself by the Dead Sea. I didn't feel like taking a swim, but I did stop at some of the viewpoints to see the salt crystals built up
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54609374292_dea6424897_b.jpg)

Between the Dead Sea and Wadi Musa (the town by Petra) there's Karak castle, an old crusader castle. There's no free parking I could find, so I left my car in a paid lot (real) this time. The castle was included in the pass, which is a good thing, because it wasn't all too impressive. It's expansive, and has a great view of the surrounding area. At least when it's not hazy. Nonetheless, it was a good stop and place to stretch my legs

I continued on to Wadi Musa. As the day was coming to an end, I went straight to the Petra entrance, where I used my first of three days. The sun was pretty low, so most people were coming out as I was going down the canyon that leads to the Treasury, which is the first part of Petra. The Siq (the canyon to Petra) took me about 20 minutes to walk, but it's downhill on the way there.

When I got there, I pretty much had it to myself, which was amazing.

They were already setting up the candles for Petra After Dark as I made my way out, so I wonder if I could have stayed and gotten that for free, but I was pretty tired and hungry so I made my way out

## Day 4 - Petra
This day was a full day dedicated to Petra. Although I had visited the Treasury the day prior, there is much more to the area than just that. My plan was to hike the Backdoor Trail to skip the out and back.

The visitor center is supposed to run a shuttle between Petra and Little Petra, which is where you start the trail from. The trail is one way, so you can leave a car at either end, but it's not an out and back which is why you need a shuttle. Most people leave their car at the Petra visitor center, take the shuttle, then hike back. This is what I was planning on doing. When I inquired about it, they told me where I could meet it and I was on my way. If you're on a Jordan Pass, it's easiest to get your Petra entrance ticket (which you'll need) at the main entrance before starting the backdoor trail


When I got to the meeting point - just uphill of the visitor center, I was informed that the shuttle wouldn't run for the next hour or so, maybe more. I'm not sure if this was a function of Ramadan, or the taxi mafia, because the kind individual who gave me this information also offered me a taxi ride to the trailhead - for a "great" price... Luckily, there was a group of Germans who were talking in German and I understood they were in the same boat. I went up to them and asked them if they would drive me there with their car, leave it there, and I would drive them back to their car on the tail end. The taxi driver caught onto this and exploded into rage saying that was illegal and threatened to call the cops. We told him to go ahead and made the rest of the plan in the little German that I spoke. With that, we were on our way in their car.

Little Petra is worth a stop - it's free to enter, and although nowhere near as grand as Petra, doesn't take long to see. Once we were done there, we bargained with one of the Bedouin there to take us to the trailhead. It's possible to walk, but you can't drive and it's mostly desert to the trailhead.

At the start, the trail is hard to follow, but essentially you're aiming for [this point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tEZ7Kj276CLwn5w37). You'll know you're on the right path when you pass a booth with someone checking tickets (which is why it's important to have gotten yours from the visitor center before leaving) Once you're in the hills, the trail is easy to follow. It's not the easiest, but its 100% worth it. The views over the desert on the way up are spectacular
![](images/trips/jordan-2025/backdoor.jpeg)

Once you go over the hill and start making a turn to the left [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xFdGtLt1CofMqiKUA), you can veer off to the right to get a good viewpoint. One of the Germans went that way and saw a freshly severed goat head - so I figured I would pass on that and instead head to the Monastary
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54609374237_e633a237af_b.jpg)

There are a few more viewpoints you can visit at the top, and to continue on the path down, follow the path to the right of the Monastary. This is where the backdoor trail really shines, as you'll see the stairs that people who went the usual way had to climb up. Once you get to the valley, there's plenty to see - a mix of Roman ruins built of the red sandstone (as opposed to marble) and tombs in every state of being built and decaying. As you glance around the valley, everywhere you look you'll see cutouts in the rock

We continued out towards the Treasury, past the amphitheatre

Once we got back to the parking lot, we all hopped in my car and went back to Little Petra to drop off the Germans. On the way back , there was an amazing sunset over the desert

## Day 7 - Petra, Aqaba
Today, I was supposed to head all the way south to Aqaba. However, I still had one free entry to Petra on my Jordan pass, so I got up early and headed to the visitor center when it opened. I headed down the Siq, to the Treasury, and over to the Al Khubtha Trail. The trailhead for it is [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oAjPrkYDnBZkmQKb7) and it's a lot of stairs to go up. It took me about 45 minutes roundtrip, but I was moving really fast as I was on a schedule. The views from the top were worth it
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54610555315_1b978f6a14_b.jpg)

On the way down, my path was blocked by a few aggressive stray dogs barking/growling at me. Not wanting to test how serious they were, I took a detour. Never like to see them

After getting back to my guesthouse, I packed myself up and got on the road to Aqaba. The drive was uneventful, I got to Aqaba in the early afternoon and went for a dive for the rest of the day. I went with Red Sea Dive Center and would recommend them

## Day 5 - Aqaba, Wadi Rum
I had a brief morning in Aqaba where I visited the fort. Entrance was free, maybe because the guard was off duty, but I'm pretty sure it was included on the Jordan Pass. The fort has art installations in rooms, so it's a nice quick visit. 
![](images/trips/jordan-2025/fort.jpeg)

I also checked out the Arab Revolt Plaza, but there's not much there. After that, I packed up my things and headed back north towards Wadi Rum. I had booked a half day tour for sunset with Bedoin Directions - with lunch included, that cost 50JOD. I checked into the visitor center - again entrance was included with the Jordan Pass - and headed to the parking lot

Lunch was great, we started with the tour at Lawrence's Spring

Continued to Khasali Canyon, Um Fruth Arch, and the Chicken Rock. The scenery is stunning
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54610460728_3e81710562_b.jpg)

My driver also offered to drop me off and let me walk through the desert, which I went for. Close to sunset, he picked me up, and drove me up to a viewpoint where I watched quite possibly one of the best sunsets of my life
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54609374027_7da59a67b4_b.jpg)

After some tea and cookies to break the fast, we headed back to the parking lot. By the time we got there, it was dark. I still had to drive almost all the way back up to Amman, which proved to be pretty dangerous as the highway was so poorly lit and my car's lights didn't work well. Eventually, I made it up to Madaba - only having hit 2 pieces of plastic or other trash in the road. I returned the car the next day and flew out to Doha

## Impressions
As with many people, Petra is the main draw to Jordan. Since I was in the area, I figured I would go see it, especially if the war meant tourism was low it would be a win win - I could help tour operators, and get to see it while it was a little less crowded. This notion was spot on, and both were well appreciated - I think my guide in Wadi Rum was pretty happy to have a customer, it sounded like it hadn't been as steady as usual. He even discounted prices a little. Again, there was no observable impact that the war had on my trip in any way, except for making things pretty empty

Driving wise, it wasn't the most challenging I've done, but especially in Amman, the driving was pretty "involved". Timid drivers might not do well, as you need to be quite assertive. This is aggravated in traffic, where you really need to be pushy, or you'll go nowhere. I had no issues, however. There are random police checkpoints - they flagged me down a few times. All times, I rolled down the window, they saw I was a tourist, asked me where I was from (sounded more out of curiosity, really) and sent me on my way

I had initially considered skipping Wadi Rum, but was really glad I didn't. Although I think I was justified in skipping the desert in Oman, Wadi Rum is different due to its rock formations. The red sand is also really alien, and makes for some really cool terrain.

Scams and tourist traps are definitely present. I didn't fall for any this time, but I definitely was accosted a lot. Definitely not ideal, and perhaps aggravated by the lull in tourism.

Jordan is another country I'm not sure if I would go back to, despite having overall a positive experience. I've seen the highlights, and I'm not sure what I would do, other than dive more in Aqaba. Petra, surprisingly, did start to get old on the third day - but maybe after some time it would be cool to visit again
