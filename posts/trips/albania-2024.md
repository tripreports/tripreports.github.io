## Getting There

I flew into Tirana airport from OTP. Flights out were challenging, so I bused into Kosovo and flew out of these

## Getting Around
To get around, I rented a car. Prices weren't high, but the only options availale were manual

## Day 1 - Berat
I landed the night prior in Tirana, immigrated without issue, and picked up my rental car. In the morning, I woke up, got some food, and headed out for Berat.

In Berat, I put my car in a paid lot, and started exploring. First stop was the old town on the other side of the river. It's well maintained, and has a lot of streets you can walk around

Getting up higher gives you a better view of the other side of the river

I spent the rest of the day just wandering around on the main side of the river, seeing the mosques and cathedrals. As the sun set, I headed back to the old town, enjoying things getting lit up

## Day 2 - Berat, Lukova
I started the day by hiking up to the castle in Berat. It gives a great viewpoint over the town, as well as the valleys around

Once I had had enough of the view, I headed to the hotel to get packed up and on my way. I had two stops for the day, the first being Gjipe Beach. Getting there is easy, and I parked at the paid lot at the top of the road and hiked down. The hike down was dusty and hot, so I was glad to be able to take a dip

I was able to change in one of the stalls behind the beach, which was tucked away. After some time enjoying the beach, I headed back up on the hill and got on my way. When I arrived to Palermo Castle, I noticed a old sub base on the other side of the bay

I didn't ending up going to the castle, but I did fly over it

I got to my hotel in Lukova towards the end of the day, and caught a pretty nice sunset with dinner

## Day 3 - Butrint, Qeparo, Tirana
An early start today as I needed to get all the way south to Butrint. Butrint is a peninsula with Roman Ruins, right up agaisnt the southern border of Albania and Greece. I wanted a few hours to walk around the island, before the crowds showed up. I was pretty impressed with the quantity of the ruins, they're pretty well spread out, there are quite a few

At the top of the hill on the island, there's a little museum where they've amassed artifacts

Once I had enough of that, I head back north, this time to (Upper) Qeparo. The road up is steep and narrow, and I think it took just about every horsepower my Skoda had. There's a small parking lot right off the road, immediately before you get to the village, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3mppMTmEotGudnzy5). The village is half inhabited, half in decay, which makes it really interesting to walk around. Reminded me a lot of the mudbrick villages in Oman, and I definitely enjoyed my time here

It sits right on the edge of a cliff, and it seems the houses closer to the cliff are the adandoned ones

Leaving the village on a path you can get to more ruins which sit on a cliff's edge, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C5ra7dHdRPb2AQzt9)

After some time there, I headed back north. Before returning my rental car, I explored some of the downtown Tirana

After returning my car at the airport, I took an airport bus into town, a bus that went the complete wrong direction, then a taxi which underestimated how much it would cost to get me to the south bus terminal, and walked the rest of the way. I had a hotel that was conveniently located right in the bus terminal, so I didn't have to go anywhere the following day to catch my bus
