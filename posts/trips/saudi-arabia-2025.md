## Visa

For Saudi Arabia, I needed to apply for an e-visa. The process was easy, and the visa was granted instantly. It was on the expensive side, especially taking into account the health insurance, costing a little over $100 USD. It was made very clear to me that, as a non-Muslim, parts of the country were strictly off limits to me.

## Getting There

Getting to and around in Saudi Arabia is easy, especially with so many large airports in the region. However, often flight times are really early in the morning, or really late at night, which can make timing them weird. I was able to find flights that arrived from Doha landing at 9pm in Jeddah, and back to Doha from Al Ula leaving at 11am, which I consider to be pretty reasonable flight times. 

## Day 1

I arrived in Jeddah in the evening on the 18th. Immigration was easy - although customs was really suspicious that my sunglasses might have had cameras in them. Not sure why they were more concerned about that vs the full frame camera and lenses I had in my backpack, but once they were satisfied, I was on my way. My visit was entirely within the dates of Ramadan. Due to the high temperatures in the country during the day, and especially given it was Ramadan, everything is very active at night, and sleepy during the morning and early afternoon. I had Careem downloaded, and used that from the airport which was easy enough. Upon arrival at my hotel, the Ibis in the city center, I was informed that they had cancelled my reservation. Which was weird, as I had checked in online from Doha and explicitly noted that I would be arriving late. After some time, the manager was able to move me to a room in the adjacent serviced apartments, as the hotel itself was fully booked. That ended up being an upgrade, so I'm not complaining in the end. Given that I was using an eSIM, I didn't have a Saudi number, which made ordering food difficult as all the apps needed to send a code to a Saudi number. I eventually found one (MrSool, I think) which I was able to set up and order from to get myself some dinner

## Day 2

It was a slow morning for me as I had some things to take care of, and I wasn't enticed to go out in the middle of the day due to the high temperatures, so I ended up getting out around 3pm. Although I had aspirations to see both the old town (Al Balad) and then head up the waterfront to see the floating mosque, once I got to the old town, I decided to stay there and explore, and visit the mosque on a later trip. The old town is beautiful - many of the buildings are in various states of restoration.

There are plenty of little restaurants everywhere, although they were all closed during the day. The old town is a great place to just walk around, as there are fun things to find everywhere

As the sun sets, the alleys start to light up in golden light, making everything picturesque

I continued to walk around, as I wanted to stick around to see it come to life at sundown. The closer we got to sunset, more and more people started hanging around food vendors, clearly getting ready to break their fast

Immediately after the call to prayer, I noticed workers walking around, handing out dates and water to everyone. I was even offered some, which I thought was really generous, and was well received as even I was getting hungry. After a little while longer, I headed back to my apartment as I had to be up on the earlier side for a flight the next morning. 

I would definitely love to go back to Jeddah and spend more time there - this visit was a bonus I got on the way to Al Ula, but there are definitely more things to see than I had time for 

## Day 3

My flight to Al Ula was supposed to leave at 9:45am, but I was a little worried about getting a Careem to the airport, so I made sure to give myself extra time in case most of the drivers were asleep. Luckily, I had no issues getting one, and got to the airport early enough to checkout the lounge - which was mostly shut down foodwise for Ramadan. There was some packaged food and water, but that was about it. The flight to Al Ula was delayed slightly, but otherwise quick and standard. I flew on Saudia, which was fine

Upon arrival to ULH, I went straight to the rental car counter, hoping that they wouldn't need an IDP. Luckily, my US drivers license was enough, and I was able to get out to my car pretty quickly. I found prices in Al Ula to be a little on the higher side, an my car was no exception - $125 USD for the 3 days I needed it

The airport is about a 30 minute drive to the main part of town. After getting settled in my guesthouse, I took a nap, as I didn't have much planned for the day. However, as things started to cool off and the sun started going down, I headed out to Elephant Rock. It's another drive of about 30 minutes. The rock lights up nicely at sunset, and it's possible (but perhaps not entirely allowed, I wasn't sure) to climb up the rock behind it for a better view.

Going high enough gives a good 360 view of the surrounding area, which is very similar to Wadi Rum in Jordan and very beautiful.

After sunset, I headed back, stopping in the town to get some food. I found that it took a good amount of time after sunset for stores to open, as owners were likely out enjoying a meal

## Day 4

An early start today, as I had booked myself a "wildlife safari" at Hegra. Most of the attractions in Al Ula require booking through the official government guide service, but luckily they're all very fairly prices, especially taking into account the 50% Ramadan discount I managed to get. 

I wasn't 100% certain what the safari was going to be, but I had figured that since it started at the Hegra main gate, we would get to see Hegra. That turned out to be incorrect - instead we headed into the wildlife preserve that's adjacent to Hegra. The tour started at 6:30am, and given we were in a desert, it was actually pretty chilly - a good change. There were only 7 people on the tour, so we only took one open air jeep out. The start of the tour was uneventful, although the sunrise was beautiful, and I saw some others enjoying it from a hot air balloon

As we neared the end of the reserve, we started to see some wildlife. First, the antelopes, which we ended up seeing a few herds of

And, on the way back, the Oryx. It was fun to see one in real life after having seen so many depictions of them on the tails of Qatar's planes

On the way back, we even spotted a fox. I wasn't fast enough with the camera to capture it, though.

The safari wrapped up a little early, and as it was still pretty cool out, I headed back into Al Ula to visit the old town. I loved seeing the mudbrick villages in Oman, so I was excited to get back to them here. Part of the old town has been restored

All around the old town, both in the restored and unrestored parts, there are some displays of arts and crafts outside
![](images/trips/saudi-arabia-2025/art.jpeg)

If you keep walking, there will be a pretty obvious entrance to the less restored part of it, which felt much more authentic like the ones in Oman. It's well shaded, with some fun decorations in some of the halls
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54610248841_f71bac367f_b.jpg)

It's possible to climb the small mound which allows for a good view over the unrestored part - which I highly recommend

After that, things were pretty warm out, so I headed back to my room to rest until the evening, where I headed up to the Harat Viewpoint, which is another great place to catch sunset. It's a bit of a drive, but worth it as you get to look over the valley and oasis which make up Al Ula

## Day 5

Another early start today, where I had booked a tour of Jabal Ikmah and Dadan, which started at 7:45am. This tour ended up being just me, one other tourist, the driver, and the guide, so everything was very personal which I liked. The first stop on the tour was right behind the visitor's center, where we were able to catch a view of Dadan - tombs carved into the mountains, with the lion sculpture. They provide telescopes, but you have to stay well below and away from the tombs.
![](images/trips/saudi-arabia-2025/dadan.jpeg)

For the next stop on the tour, we hopped on a tour bus to see the archeological site of the old city associated with the tombs. As it's still under excavation, there wasn't much to see, but it was really interesting to learn about the history. For the last stop on the trip, we headed over the Jabal Ikmah. This is a valley with a bunch of petroglyphs, some of the best I've seen.

There are also drawings of animals
![](images/trips/saudi-arabia-2025/petroglpyhs.jpeg)

After getting to see the valley, and a quick stop to make your own petroglyph on a rock, the tour was over. I was expecting us to get taken back to the visitors center, but the bus instead went to a parking lot near Winter Park. The driver, who spoke no English, gestured for us to get off, and left. After 15 minutes, it was clear no one was going to pick us up, so I ended up just walking back to my car.

From there, I headed over to the oasis, which has a variety of trails you can walk around. They're super fun, as they go through actively maintained gardens, mudbrick house ruins, and date farms. It's an excellent place for a walk, especially as the day gets warmer, as it's mostly shaded
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54610449679_93c8eb146d_b.jpg)

With a quick pitstop at the guesthouse for some food and a rest, I headed back out for my last tour - and ironically the main reason I wanted to visit Al Ula: Hegra. Apparently, not so long ago, it was possible to drive yourself between all the sites at Hegra, but that has changed, and you have to go on a tour. The tours run on big tour buses, and this was one of the only ones that I found was almost fully booked. Each tour has a guide, as well as a "bodyguard" who mostly helps to bring up the rear and make sure nobody goes anywhere they shouldn't.

The tours stop at all the major tombs, and give a lot of the history of them as well. Definitely worth it, but it would of course be more interesting to go through at my own pace, especially to see if I could break away from the crowd. Nonetheless, Hegra is definitely worth the visit even immediately after Petra. Despite the tombs being made in a very similar fashion (no surprise given the Nabateans made both) the tombs being more dispersed in the desert makes for a different experience

After the tour, on the way back, I stopped again at the Oasis trail for a wander as the sunset. After grabbing dinner in town, I headed back to the guesthouse. My flight the next morning left for Doha at 11am, so I didn't have any time to see anything else

## Impressions of Al Ula
Al Ula is a very tourism centric town, but it's clear that they've made a very unified effort to maintain a positive experience, as well as preserve their historical sites, both of which I can appreciate. Especially when comparing Petra to Hegra, it's clear to see the difference - where I was constantly haggled and offered souvenirs and guide services in Petra, never once was I in Al Ula. Yes, I did have to use the guide services in Al Ula to see the monuments, but it wasn't a racket - prices were fair and transparent and I booked everything ahead of time. It makes for a much more relaxing atmosphere

Driving was super easy in Al Ula - I wouldn't want to drive in Jeddah if I didn't have to, but roads were empty and for the most part well maintained. Speed cameras are along the roads, so just be aware of those.

Everything was running smoothly during Ramadan, with the exception of restaurants. I'm familiar with that, so it was no issue for me, but just something to be aware of. 

Although I'm not sure I'd return to Al Ula specifically, having seen most of it, I would absolutely return to Saudi Arabia after my experience. Everyone I met was extremely friendly - English was pretty widespread. The weather makes it so I wouldn't visit for a good chunk of the year, but I will definitely be back to see some of the other historical monuments
