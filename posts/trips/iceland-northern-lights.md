# Chasing Northern Lights in Iceland

**Duration:** 7 days
**Route:** Reykjavik → South Coast → East Fjords → North Iceland
**Season:** October 2025
**Trip Type:** Nature, Adventure & Photography

## Overview

Iceland had been on my bucket list for years, primarily to witness the Northern Lights. This week-long road trip through Iceland's dramatic landscapes, combined with multiple aurora sightings, made for an unforgettable adventure. October proved to be the perfect time - fewer tourists than summer, but not as harsh as deep winter.

## Day 1: Arrival in Reykjavik

**Flight:** Icelandair from JFK to Keflavik (5.5 hours)
**Arrival:** 6:30 AM local time

Picked up my rental 4x4 (essential for Ring Road travel) and drove the 45 minutes to Reykjavik. After checking into my hotel, I spent the day fighting jet lag by exploring the capital.

### Reykjavik Highlights
- **Hallgrímskirkja Church** - iconic architecture with panoramic city views from the tower
- **Harpa Concert Hall** - stunning modern glass building by the harbor
- **Rainbow Street** - colorful street art in the downtown area
- **Laugavegur Shopping Street** - Icelandic design stores and cafes

**Evening:** First Northern Lights hunt - joined a tour but conditions weren't ideal (too cloudy). The guide assured us we'd have more chances. Back to the hotel by midnight, exhausted but excited.

## Day 2-3: The Golden Circle & South Coast

### Golden Circle (Day 2)

Started early to beat the tour buses.

- **Þingvellir National Park** - walked between tectonic plates (literally between North America and Europe)
- **Geysir Geothermal Area** - watched Strokkur erupt every 5-10 minutes
- **Gullfoss Waterfall** - massive two-tiered waterfall, absolutely powerful
- **Secret Lagoon** - more authentic than Blue Lagoon, perfect for relaxing

**Night:** Clear skies! Self-drove to a dark spot near Selfoss. At 11 PM, the Northern Lights appeared - dancing green ribbons across the sky. Stayed out until 2 AM photographing. Absolutely magical.

### South Coast (Day 3)

Drove along Route 1 towards Vik.

- **Seljalandsfoss** - walked behind the waterfall (bring rain gear!)
- **Skógafoss** - climbed the 500+ steps for a top view
- **Sólheimasandur Plane Wreck** - 4km hike to the famous DC-3 wreck
- **Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach** - dramatic basalt columns and powerful waves
- **Vik** - charming small town, stayed the night

**Night:** More Northern Lights! Watched from the beach - the contrast of aurora against black sand and ocean was surreal.

## Day 4: Glacier Hiking & Ice Cave

### Vatnajökull Glacier

Joined a guided glacier hike on Sólheimajökull.

- Fitted with crampons and ice axes
- Hiked across the glacier for 3 hours
- Explored deep crevasses and ice formations
- Guide explained glacier movement and climate change impact

### Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon

Continued east to one of Iceland's most iconic locations.

- **Glacier Lagoon** - icebergs floating in the lagoon
- **Diamond Beach** - ice chunks on black sand, incredibly photogenic
- **Boat tour** - got up close to massive icebergs
- Saw seals swimming near the icebergs

**Accommodation:** Small guesthouse near Höfn

**Night:** Best aurora display yet! The lights were visible from the guesthouse window. Danced overhead in green, purple, and pink. Set up my camera for time-lapse. Stayed out until 3 AM.

## Day 5: East Fjords

One of the quieter regions, less touristy but incredibly beautiful.

- **Scenic drives** through fjords and mountain passes
- **Stöðvarfjörður** - colorful houses and charming harbor
- **Petra's Stone Collection** - quirky museum in Stöðvarfjörður
- **Wild reindeer** - saw a small herd from the road

The drive was long but stunning. Stopped constantly for photos.

**Stayed:** Egilsstaðir

## Day 6: North Iceland & Akureyri

### Mývatn Region

One of Iceland's geological wonders.

- **Mývatn Nature Baths** - less crowded than Blue Lagoon, milky blue water
- **Grjótagjá Cave** - hot spring cave (too hot to bathe in now)
- **Dimmuborgir** - dramatic lava formations, felt like another planet
- **Hverir Geothermal Area** - bubbling mud pots and steam vents, very active
- **Námaskarð Pass** - otherworldly colored mountains

### Akureyri

Iceland's northern capital.

- Charming town with good restaurants
- **Akureyri Church** - beautiful architecture
- **Botanical Gardens** - surprisingly lush despite the latitude

**Dinner:** Fresh fish at a local restaurant

**Night:** Aurora forecast was perfect (KP6). Drove out of town. The lights were INCREDIBLE - the strongest display of the trip. Full sky coverage with rapid movement. Absolutely worth the trip alone.

## Day 7: Return to Reykjavik

Long drive back (about 5 hours) but took time to enjoy the scenery.

### Stops Along the Way
- **Hvammstangi** - seal watching spot
- **Grabbed coffee** in small towns along Route 1
- **Borgarnes** - had lunch at Settlement Center

### Final Evening in Reykjavik

Treated myself after a week of early mornings and long drives.

- **Blue Lagoon** - finally visited on the way to the airport area
- Relaxed in the warm water for 2 hours
- **Dinner** in Reykjavik - hit up a recommended seafood restaurant
- **Craft beer bar** - tried Icelandic microbrews

**Late Night:** One last aurora check - clear skies and a faint display visible from the city. Perfect ending.
