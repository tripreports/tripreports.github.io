## Visa

The process to get a visa was easy for me - I used the online portal to apply for an eVisa. The application was easy, and even had to an option to expedite it, which I greatly appreciated and used, as I was planning this trip at the last minute.

## Getting Around

There are plenty of ways to get around in Baku, and even from the airport into the city was easy. All I needed was a BakuCard (and Google Maps with an eSIM). Is it possible to buy them at the airport, and the card machines are located right outside the airport (exit and take a sharp left or right). I was only able to get it to work with cash, and since the ATM I used at the airport only gave me a 50 Manat note, I had to break it at a store outside. I put 12 Manat on the card, which was more than enough for the extent I used the public transport for. Once you have the BakuCard, you can use the[airport shuttle](https://airport.az/en/transport/aero-express/), which is the best option to get into town. All buses that use the BakuCard operate similarly, where you scan the card at the entrance.

## Day 1

I arrived to my hotel around 16:00, having gotten in in the afternoon from Doha. Heydar Aliyev airport is beautiful - brand new and efficient. Although I didn't have much time, at the suggestion of very hospitable staff at the Ritz Carlton, after dropping my bags, I took the bus to the east end of the corniche, right by The Crescent. It's worth noting that the Ritz Carlton also provides a shuttle into town, which is an equally handy option, but since there was a bus stop right by the hotel, I opted for that as it was faster. There's a very nice park where you can walk along the waterfront.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7367.jpg?w=1024)
In the background are the flame towers - one of the very iconic buildings in Baku. You can walk almost the entire way to them along the waterfront, but at the end you need to go up the hill they sit on. Make this turn right at the Carpet Museum - another incredibly iconic building.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7399.jpg?w=1024)
There is a funicular, but I would recommend instead taking the stairs up, as you can turn around when there's a break in the trees and get a good vantage on the city![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7413.jpg?w=1024)
At the top of the hill there is a mosque, memorial, and a park with a great view of the flame tower. They're all worth seeing, but the for sunset the best is to be in the park, which has an amazing view on both the city and the flame towers. As it gets darker, they light up the flame towers![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7444.jpg?w=1024)
And once the sun is fully set, the lit up city scape is nice to see![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7441.jpg?w=1024)

## Day 2

I had some work to catch up on at the start of the day, so I was slow to get going. However, the first stop for the day was the Heydar Aliyev center. Possibly the most iconic building in Baku, it has not only very interesting architecture, but also a museum inside. I would recommend walking around the entire building.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7472.jpg?w=1024)
There are two separate museums, I only visited the main museum, which had a great amount of history and art from Azerbaijan and the surrounding area. In hindsight, I wish I had also visited the car museum. However, I had already spent a good few hours here, so I thought it was time to be moving on. I had a little bit of a slow afternoon, but walked the corniche again during sunset.

## Day 3

Today started out early, as I had a few things I wanted to see before my flight out (which was technically 3am the next day). The first thing to visit was Yanar Dag - the burning mountain. Since I was using busses, it took me somewhere between an hour and a half and 2 hours to get there, as it is quite far out of Baku. I was able to get there using only busses, but the second half of the voyage used bus 147, an older bus. This bus doesn't use the BakuCard, and instead you pay for it in cash. What I did, and saw others doing, is get on the bus without paying, and pay on the way out to signal a stop to the driver. There should be a sign at the front of the bus which shows how much the fare is - for the 147, when I took it, it was 40 Qapik (40 Qapik = 0.4 manat). For my return trip, I didn't have exact change, but if you hand the driver a 1 manat note, he will give you change. As far as Yanar Dag goes, I was quite underwhelmed. It is cool to see a mountain which is on fire, but after that wore off, there really isn't anything else to do out there.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7526.jpg?w=1024)
I also went as I had seen there was a mud volcano on Google Maps which was a short walk from Yanar Dag -**I wasn't able to find it**. I walked around the area quite a bit, but did not see a mud volcano. Overall, this is the one stop of the trip that I wouldn't recommend unless you have extra time.

After getting back into Baku, I had planned to walk around the old town a little, and then see the Carpet Museum. However, as soon as I started walking around the old town, I decided to spend more time there and skip the carpet museum, as the old town was quite beautiful, and I had seen a small sample of carpets at the Heydar Aliyev center. It is free to walk around the old town, and all the main highlights have signs to point you in the right direction.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7549.jpg?w=1024)
There are quite a few things to explore in the old town, and I spend quite a few hours here, and was here until sunset.![](https://yetanothertravelblog8.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8t4a7761.jpg?w=1024)
Afterwards, I headed back to my hotel, and got a few hours of sleep before making my way to the bus stop for the airport express. Given the schedule of flights out of GYD, it runs pretty late, which was nice.
