## Visa

Kosovo is Visa Free for US Citizens

## Getting There

I was having trouble finding flights out of Tirana, but it was very easy to find flights out of PRN - so I decided to pop into Kosovo for an afternoon, check it out, and leave from there

## Getting Around
Given I was just in the downtown, I walked everywhere

## Day 1
Immigration between Albania and Kosovo was easy, and we arrived on schedule in the early afternoon to the Pristina bus stop. I walked from there to my hotel to drop my bags, then headed out. Number one priority, of course, was the Bill Clinton statue

On the way to the statue, I passed the newborn monument

And the heroine monument

From there, I headed up to the national library - an iconic brutalist design

Around the library was an old abandoned church, which I went over to see

Finally, to wrap up the day, I went over the the flea market, where there were all sorts of knockoffs for sale

And that was it - an afternoon in Kosovo. Not sure if I would visit Pristina again, as I think I high the highlights in my brief time here
